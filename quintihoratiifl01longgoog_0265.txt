l'behistorycf this cde is easily mede out. The Vindelici were a tribe whose territoriss
lay between the Danube end the lnke· of constance, comprising the greater part of
modern Bovario end Suebis, end some pert cf the 'lyr-ol. 'ibe Raeti ley to the south
of the Vindelici, end reeched to Irnke Come cn the south. These tribes, whom the
historims describe es very lieres snd werlilre, commenosd e system oi predatory incur·
riuus into Cisalpine Gaul, in which they sppeur to heve pructised the greatest stro-
citics (Dion Oess. liv. 22 ς Strabo, p. 206). Augustus wus st this time (nuc. teo-89)
in Transalpino Gsul, and Tiberius uns with him. Drusus, his step-son, end younger

the Tridentino Alps und defeated signslly. But though driven from Itely they oon·

nore troop to his brether’s οοοίτὲοττοο, end between them they effectunlly humbled the
tribes, whose territories were constituted s Roman province, esterwnrds named the

the dennuni end Breuni. 'l'he whole ct' this wer took place in the spring end summer
