INTRODUCTION. ν xxix

ipsius habui ostendi '' (on S. i. 6. 41). Τ10 same Scholiast refers moro
tlran once 10 books that had been written on the persons mentioned by
1101000 Α reference to Estrd's work spoken of in the Prefacs will
show that a catalogue of these persons embraces nearly all the distin·
guisbed men of the day, with most of whom Horace was on friendly
1811118.

’1101101100 adopted by Horace from the Greek are thirteen in
number in the 0110001111 six in the Epodes. I purpose saying only 0
few words on each.

C. i. 1.-Τ10 metra 01 this Ode is one of three, called after
Asclepiades, a lyric 000101 uncertain date. It consiste 01 single lines
dirided thus:

..-ustulati-..9

The 0000010 usually falls on the long syllable 01101 the end 01 110
0000011 1001. There are two exceptions only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and
ir. 8. 17. The Greeks did not follow this rule, and their lines were
less monotonous 10 consequence. The division 01 1110 100110 by
choriambi is against 110 obvious rhythm. O. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to
the same.

C. i. 2.-Τ110 010110 takes 110 00100 from Sappho. It consiste 01
0100100 01 four verses each. The first three are alike, and consist 01
1001 11001000, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always sub·
stitutes 0 spondes 101 110 second trochee, with one uncertain exception,
C. S. 70. The fourth verse consiste of a dactyl and spondae, and 10
00001100 Adonis.

Thisis one of the commoneat mctres. It differs in Horace’s hands
from the Greek usage bytho less frequent introduction of the trocheo
inthe second place, and from the 0000010 usually falling after the
fifth syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from the
rigoor 01 the metra, 0 defeat which Horace seems to have perceived
rrben he wrote the Carmen Seeculare and the Sapphic Odes of the
100111 book'.
