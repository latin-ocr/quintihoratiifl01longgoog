SATIRARUM 11. 3. 467

Nam male re gesta curn vellem mittere operto

Me capite in flumen, dexter stetit et, Cave faxis

Te quidquam indignum3 pudor, inquit, te malus angit,
Insanos qui inter vereare insanus haberi. 4ο
Primum nam inquiram quid sit furere: hoe si erit in te

Solo nil verbi pereas quin fortiter addam.

Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri

Caecum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex

Autumat. Haec populos, haec magnos formula reges 45
Excepto sapiente tenet. Nunc accipe quare

Desipiant omnes aeque ac tu qui tibi nomen

insano posuere. Velut silvis ubi passim

Palantes error certo de tramite pellit,

Ille sinistrorsum, hic dextrorsum abit, unus utrique 50
Error, sed variis illudit partibus5 hoc te

Crede modo insanum, nihilo ut sapientior ille
