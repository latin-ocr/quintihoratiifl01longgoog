OARMEN XVI.

The poet Stesichorus, as the story goes, lost his eyesight as a punishment for a pean
in which he appears to here repeated the ordinary stories against Helen, and did not
recover it till he had written another poem recanting his opprobrious verses. Of this
παλινῳδία, which is referred to in lipod. xvii. 42, and which was very familiar tc the
sociante, Plato has preserved the opening verses in the Phaedrus, p, ate, A. lt begins
thus :-

ruis poem had a plain purpose with which the ode before us has nothing iu commo.
Nevertheless it has been generally supposed till of late years to be an imitation of susi·
chorus, and some of the grammariaus have prefixedtothe ode the title “Ad Tyndaridem,”
no doubt under the same impression. 'l'he foundation of this opinion appears to have
been the statement of Acron: “ Hanc oden in satisfactionem facit amicae suae, imitatus
Stesichorum politam Siculum qui vituperationem scribens Helenae oaemtus est et postes
responso Apollinis landem ejus scripsit et oculorum aspectum recepit” He does aot

have the inscription “ Palinodia Gratidiae ad Tyndaridem,’' and whoever invented this Ξ
inscription must have supposed the ode to have been addressed to the daughter of that ³

among others Heindorf on S. i. 8. Fruulre is decidedly of that opinion, and supposes
this ode to have been written about the same time with Epod. xvii, and for the same
mock purpose. 1 think there cau be little doubt in the mind of any oue who reads this ¹
poem, that it was composed (though not in seriousness) with reference to some verses
Horace had actually written,¹ and that it is nota mere translation of Stesichorus' or any
other poem, while at the same time there are Greek ideas iu it, which he borrovcd
from that or some other source. Beyond this I am not bold enough to go.
