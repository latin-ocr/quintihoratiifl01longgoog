viii PREFACE.

though sometimes they are not supported by any that are known l
now.

The editions thatI have consulted Ι will not tire the reader hy
enumerating. No classical author has been edited and commented
upon so often aa Horace. The editions Ι have always referred to
when a difficulty of interpretation occurred are those of Ascensins
(1519), with the scholia of Aenon and Porphyrion, Lambinus,
Cruquius (for his commentator), Torrentius, Gesner, Deering, Dil-

Mr. Long,.whose advice Ι have likewise followed in many other

Ι have not entered at any length upon the chronology of Horace's
poems. Ι have referred to the subject in the Introduction, and
have done my best to determine the date of each poem so faras
there are reasonable grounds to argue upon. The principa] autho-
rities on this subject now relied upon and referred to in this book
are Franke (Fasti Horatiani, Berlin, 1839) and Kirchner (Quaes-
