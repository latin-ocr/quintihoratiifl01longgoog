'I'his work of correcting Horace and other writers still goes on,
and will go cn as long as there are printers to print. Itis doubtful
whether wa are going backwards or forwards in the critical art, for
some of the newest emendations are the worst. We have 1 11111111
by Lachmann and Haupt (Keller) to write ‘'lhynus’ for ‘Poenus’
in C. ii. 13, 14. Ido not know what objection these critice made

to ‘Poenus :³ Bentley 1111 113 13 pass unmolested. ‘'I'hynus' was
probably suggested by ‘Thyna merce’ (C. iii. 7. 3), and ‘Bithyna'
(C. i. 35. 7; Epp. i. 6. 33). Η111 the argument turns entirely on
the propriety of the expression ‘navita Bosporum Poenus ε’ the
evidence is for the common reading. Horace continually uses
proper names 31 give life and complexion to his poetry, and there

are instaures in which he uses them, as far aa we can see, where
other 111111 names would do as well if they had suited his verse.
If the ‘ navita' must have some life put into him bya name, Icould
not think of one better than Poenus, whether Horace used it in the
larger or mora limitad sense, nor if the poet wished 31 113 his
‘navita' on the road 3ο some great and distem 1113 of commarca,
could he have chosen a more troublesome course for him than beat-
ing up tha Bosporus against a strong current. What the ‘navita
Thynus' would bc doing 311111 Ι cannot tell, as 3111 Thyni were not

does not like the expression ‘ibam’ alone, and 111 defends 1111 ‘ut' by quoting among
other passages 11111111111111, Phormio, 1111121 ‘Ut abii ebs te, nt forteobrism 1111111
