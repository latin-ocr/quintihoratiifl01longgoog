xxiv INTRODUC'HON.

as it would seem, the sixth Satira of the second book, which book
therefore was not probably published till the eud of 724 or the beginning

ol the next year, when Horace was about thirty-five years old.
When Augustus returned from Asia, in Anac. 725, aud closed the

. gates of danus, being the acknowledged head oi the republie, Horace

appeared amongst his most hearty adherente. He wrote on this occasion
one of his best Odes (i. 2), and employed his pen in forwerding those
reforma which it was the first object of Augustus to effect. (See Intro·
duction to Ο. ii. 15). His most striking Odes appear for the most part
to have been written after the establishment of peace. Some may have
been written before, and probably were. But for some reason it would
seem that he gave himself more to lyrie poetry after his thirty-fifth year
than he had done before. He had most likely studied the Greek poeta
while he was strithem, and some of his imitations may have been
written early. If so, they were most probably improved and polished
from time to time (for he must have had them by him, known perhaps
only to a few friends, for many years) till they bacam the graeeful

specimens of artificial composition that they are. Horace continued to ἲ

employ himself in this kind of writing (on a variety of subjecta, oon·
vivial, amatory, political‚ moral ς some original, many no doubt suggested
by Greek poema) till sana 730, when Iam inclined to think the first
three books of the Odes were published. Ioannot here discuss the
subject, but Ι have considered and stated in the case of each Ode the
evidences, if any, that it contains of its date, and I can find none which
may not be placed in that year or before it Bentley’s theory, which
limits Horace to one species oi' composition at a time, and supposes each
of the first three books of Odes to havebeenpublishedseparately,1have
no saith in; and he overlooks the lact that the twenty-fourth Ode estha
first book was certainly written four years alter that in which he places
the publication of that book. Clinton, who supporta Bentley (Fast Hell.
rao. 38), esu only do so by supposiug that in the present copies some
pisces may have been transposed, which is begging the question.
Ihenke has arrived, as far as I can judge, attha right conclusion upon
this subject. During this period Horace appears to have passed his
time at Rome among the most distinguished meu of the day, or at his
house in the country, paying occasional visits to Tibur, Praeneste,
and Baiae, with indifferent health‚ which required change of air.
About the year nme. 728 he was nearly killed by the falling of a
trae, on his own estate, which accident hohas recorded in oue of his
Odes (ii. 13), and occasionally refers to. Iu the same stanzahe resera to
a storm in which he was nearly lost off Cape Palinurus¹‚ on me west
