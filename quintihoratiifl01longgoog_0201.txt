CARMINUM III. 7.

Sed rusticorum mascula militum
ProleS, Sabellis docte ligonibus
Vereere glebas et severae

Matris ed arbitrium recisos
Portare firetes, sol ubi montium
Mutaret umbras et juga demeret

Tempus egens abeunte curru.
Damnoeu quid non imminuit dies?
Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit

Nos nequiores, mox daturos

Progeniem vitiosiorem.
