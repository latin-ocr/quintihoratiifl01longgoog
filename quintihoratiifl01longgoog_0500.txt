Stertinius appears to hove been an authority among the Stoios oi ιιο day· Tit
Scholiasta tell us he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school. Mau

by Quintilian (iii. 1, 21) as the author of a treatiae ou orutory, though, as ιο tyr, ιιι
Stoioe troubled themselves less with rhetorio then with didacus.

The diseourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that ereryman in ιιο aaliz&
