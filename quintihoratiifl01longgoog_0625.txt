EPISTOLARUM 1. 7.

EPISTLH VII.

On some occasion Horace having gone into the country for change oi air on account
of his health, at the beginning of August, was tempted to stay away the whole month3
and aa he had promised Maecenas to return in a few days, he had perhaps received a
letter from his friend reminding him ot that promise, and begging him ιο come bacis.
Maecenas was a valetudinarian, and had probably' some of the querulous selflshnaas
that usually attende ou that condition. We may infer as much from that ode (ii. 17),
which begins “Cur me querelis exanimas tuisi'' aud he very likely telt the want of
lloruce's society at this time. We cau only guther the tone oi his latter or mesaage
from the character of Horace's reply. He says he has no mind to riak a return of his
aichness by going back during the autumn tc Rome3 indeed that he meant ιο be
alaeue at some worm place cn the coast through the winter3 that he was no longer
aa young and aheerl'ul as he had been3 that hc was sure Maeones liberality was
bastowed upon him in agenoreus spirit, aud that he did not mean to compromise his
independeuce3 for it¹ he could suppose such was thecuae, he would give up every
thing he had ever received rather than forfeit his liberty. He illustratas his position
by two storias-ono that of the for who got into a rossel of corn and grew so fat
there that he could not get out again (which Horace was determined to prove was not
his case), and the other a splenetic trick played by L. Philippus upon a worthy man
whom he seduced into leaving his home and vocatiou aud settling on a sarm in the
country, the result of which uuuatoral change was the total destruction ot his peace

and indepeudence. To this too Horace means to say he will never let himself be
bmlilagelit. is nothing disrespectful or augry in the Hpistle, though it might appear from

share outline lilse the above, or from a superficial reading, that there was. It was
written aster many years of intimacy, and shows pretty clearly the intlueuce Horace
had acquired with his patron; sor though Horace was not perhaps of a servile dis·
position, as servility was then reckoucd he would not have assumed this tone it he
had not been sure Maecenas would not tale offence at it.

There isuo evidence to prove when this Hpistle was written. Ῑι is generally attri-
buted to the same year as pr. 15, when Horace was meditating a winter residence on
the coast. But the date of that Epistle is also quite uncertain, and Horace in all pro·
hability passed most oi his wintere elsewhere than at Home.
