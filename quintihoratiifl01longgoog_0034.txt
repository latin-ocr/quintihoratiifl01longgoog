time. It seems from the Epistle to Florus that Horace at this time
had to resist the urgency of friends begging him ιο write, one in this
style and another in that, and that ho had no desire to gratify them and
to sacrifice his own ease ιο a pnrsuit in which it is plain he never took
any great delight He was likely to bring to it less energy, as his life
was drawing prematurely ιο a close through infirmities either contracted
or aggravatcd during his irrational campaigning with Brutus, his inupti·
tude for which he appears atterwards ιο have been perfectly aware of.
He continued ιο apply himself ιο the study of moral philosophy till his
death, which took place on the 27th November, aue. 746, or ac. 8,
in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and within a few days os its comple·
tion. Maecenas died the same year, also towards the close ol it; a
coincidence that has led some to the notion that Horace hastened his
own death that he might not have the pain of surviving his patron.
According to Suetonius his death (which be places alter bis fifty-ninth
year, as tho text erroneously stands) was so sudden that hebed not
time ιο executa hie will, which is opposed to the uotion of suicide. The
two friends were buried near one another “in extremis Esquiliis,” in
the farthest part oi the Esquiliae, that is probably without the city
walls, on the ground drained and laid ont in gardens by Maecenas.

The plan adopted in this Edition, of commenting on each poem in a
separate Introduction, rendere it unnecessary to say much in this place
upon Horace'e style and character. Tho particular style in which his
principle strength lay will be always matter of opinion. My own is, that
he is nowhere so great as in the Odes, and that of these his genius is
best shown in the Odes that relate to public affairs or men, while in some
oi the small occasional pisces, as the Ode ιο the Fonntain of Bandusia,
that on the death of Quintilius, and others, much grace and feeling
are shown. Icannot at all agree with those who think that amatory
verse-writing was Horace's strong point. With rare exceptione his
compositions of this kind, however elegant they may be, appear frigid
and passionless, bearing the stamp oi imitation, with uneqnivocsl signs
os art, and none of nature. The crowd ol mistresses that have been
gathered for him ont of his poems is beyond belief 3 aud the laborious
folly that has tried ιο classify his amonrs, ond to follow chronologi·
oally the shifting of his allectione, 1 have bad occasion to notice.
It proceeds upon an interpretation of the Odes which is foreign to
their true character. Horace was neither more nor less licentions pro·
bably than most of his contemporaries, though his biographer Suetonius
charges him with gross sensuality3 but, however this may be, tbat the
women os his Odes are in nearly every instance fictitions 1 have no
doubt whatever. Oinara⁸ seems to represent a real person3 aud with
