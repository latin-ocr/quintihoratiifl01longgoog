l'his ode, which denis with Horace's favourite subjecta, tbe lavelling power of death,
and the vanity ol wealth, and the schemas of the wealthy, is dedicated ιο no particular
friend, and is another procf of the little velue or character that odes of this class derlee
homanam03 though it was the poet's pleasure at times to attach names to them.
bhst 1 mean is, that the name we find in conjunction with such odes must usually be
looied upon aa non-essential, and that to draw inferenees from the ode, in respect to
tbe individusl nominully addressed‚ is a mistake. C. iii. 24 bears a strong resemblance
to this ode, which must have been written aster Horace became possessed of his farm
(satis beatus unicis Sabinis), and that is ull that can be said of the dete.

lu ariting the first lew verses Horace may have had in mind some lines of Bacchy·
lidae iuviting the Dioscuri to feast with him, preserved in Athenaeus (28 Bergk),

Sabine estate? Daya are passing on, end, though readyto drop into thy grave, thou
