OARMEN II.

ilonea, meaning to write on tha praisss of the country. put bis poem (whether ιι
sn aiter-thought or not may be open ιο conjecture) into the shape of ι rhapsody by u
ιιοοοηοιιὶιις nsurer who, nstra· rsciting the blessings ofa country life und sighing ior
the enjoyment estham, receiving to throw up his business and persuading himself thet
hc desires nothing so much aa retirement and a humble life, finds habit too strong for
him aud fulls back upon the sordid pursuits which after all are most congenial ιο him.
Seme may perhaps think that this little bit of satire is the chief object ior which tha
poem ιιι written. ιιι impression is thet it was commenced (whether in imitation of
ungit, Georg. ii 458 sqq„ as Franks supposes, or of a poem of Archilochus [Fr. 21.
nega] ss lachmann, or not iu imitationes any thing, which is more prebebis) as a
“laudatio vitae rusticae ” (which is the tenor of most of the inscriptions), and that the
brt sonr semes, which have been called clumsy, were edded tc give the rest s morai.
st say rste the greater part of the speech must ba admitted to bc rather out of lreep·
ing with the supposed speaker. We should not expect, ior instance, to hear a city
arares mk about sn hereditsry farm, the dungers oi the soldier and the sailor, snd tha
metiore. 'l'he last difficultyis got rid of by Doering and others, who interpret
‘amor' (r. 87) as the lova of money, which thet editor says “vix dubitari potest,”
though the word ‘hsbendi’ “paulo licentius omisit.'’ 'ihis I am quite sure is wrong ς
sud l think wa must ailow that Horace wns more intent upon his description than on
maintsiuing an sccnmte consistency between the circumstances of the speshar sud
tha smtiments ιο ιιιοιο. Βιι, however this msy be, the picture is very hmutihrl and

ιιοιιοιιὶ very true. In the most sordid minda more geuial impulses will sometimes ¹

ιοίοι but the beauties οι· nature and the cherma cf s peacelid retirement are, like

sistas itself, only attractiva in the distance and at interssls tc minda that have grown '

addictcd to the pursuit oi guin sor its own sake '1¹0 such minds domestic and innocent
plasme offer no lasting grstidmtion, and the picture oi rustic enjoyment on the ona
hand, and os the jeded but still grasping usurer struggling for s moment against his
pupansities on the other, adords ι wholesome lesson for many. Inrespectto tha date,
it can only be conjectured that Horace had tested the enjoymenta he describes so gre·
pbicsliy, and was in possessiones his form. But even that is uncertain Franks,
thinking thst Horace must have had before him Virgil’s second Georgio (458 squ),
ahich some say was not published till ιιο. 724, attributes this ode to '124 also, in
ἰιι his hiend Iochmsnn informs him he ιοοιιιι “ nimis subtiliter ignorabilia rimatus
οιο.” There is s fragment hom the comedy Νῆοοι attributed to Aristophanes (844,
M), which is very like this ode: Whethar Horace ever saw it or thought oi it when
hemming. itisimpossihle to ssy. It runs thus:-

ὅ nipe μῦρε, τοῦτο serr· dr τῇδ’ ἔνι·
οῑκεΐν pis ir type τοῦτον ἐν τῷ γηδίῳ
