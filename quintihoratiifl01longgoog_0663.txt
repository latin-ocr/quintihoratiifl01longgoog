anconem.

Το save γοα tha trouble of acking about my estate, my good Quintiun-my cropc und
my olives, my orcharde‚ meadowu, and uiuet-I will describo it to you nt full
length. 'lhere ic a chain of mountuirn broken by a uhady valley, oi which one side
neceivac thc ruys of the morning cun, thc other of thc evening. The climate yon
would like ς and when 1 tell γοα 1 have corneis and plume growing wild, and oaks
to give acorna 1ο ιαγ ewiuc and chade to their macter, γοα will think Tarentum hen
drawn nearer 1ο Rome. Thau 1 have a spring worthy 1ο give a name 1ο tha circum,
for Hebrus ie not moro clcar or cccl, good for the hcad aud good for the stomach.
'l'o thece muccla, which 1 love, and which arc in truth dalightful, γοα owe it that
your friend ie alive in September.

Yon too are counted a happy man: ccc that γοα bc ⁸03 truat not 1ο the judgmcnt
ot* othere but to your own of yourcelf, und remember thnt noua but the uage
in happy. 'ibe peoplc may think γοα cound. but if γοα arc coucciouc of c fover
in your veina, do not attempt 1ο hide 11 n any one taikn os your ware iu languagc
that cn only Angustus, γοα chrink from the lie ; but when thoy call γοα good and
wine, do you not accept the complimeuti Welh say γοα, Ι like 1ο be praised, aa
Isuppoce you do yourcelf. But do you not know that they who give can take
away their praieei Gire it buck. say they, and γοα must do co. What if they call
me thiel, parricide, doec that affect mci Who hut the vicione care l'or fulco pmice
or falae blame? Who ia the really good mani The vulgar will point to the man
who keepa the lawc, who decides important matters ac a judex, and hac weight ue a
surely and a witness ; but hin intimatos may know him better. ‘.[here ure come who
do not ein for fear of punishment ς hut the good mun is good bccausc he loven good·
ααα. Your good man who iu ao looked up to when ho sacrificos hau hia silent
prayer to Januc, Apollo, Lauerna, thet they will promote and hide hia knavery.
Icauuot ccc wharein hc ia better thcn the poor slave who stopa 1ο pick up an
aa from the parement. He who cravec will fear3 aud he who feam ic not a
free mun in my judgment. He hac decerted thc ranke of virtue who is ever
bnaied in making money. Sell him sor a clavo: he in fit for that· whereue thc
suge cau cay 1ο hic tyrnnt, “Take all 1 have, put me iu bonde if γοα will ς but when
