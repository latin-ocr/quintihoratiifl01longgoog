HORATII FLACOI

Nec pestilentem sentiet ath-ioum
Fecunda ritis nec sterilem seges
Robiginem aut dulces alumni
Pomifero grave tempus anno.
Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis
Victima pontificum secures
Cervice tinget: te nihil attinet
'lentare multa caede bidentium
Parvos coronantem marino

Rore deos fragilique myrto.
