lhis ode bas none of the appearance 00 my mind of having been written, 0000001000
01000 third book, for the purpose of cloeing end commendinga completed work, es those
sffirrn who believe the first two books were pnblisbed seperstely. There does not appear
to be any method in the arrangement of the odes between the introductory one of the
first book and the lest of the third (with the exception of the first six of that book
ebich ere evidently connected with one another)‚· and the position of thie is probably
as occidental ss 00ιο of othere. 'l'his ode appears to here been written impromptu, and
1 think the style is mech-heroic, or bnt half serious, though 000-0ωο0000100ιο 00 much
right as others to commend bis poetry and to 00 consciens ofhis own powers. Verions
00000000 of seli-commendation‚ on the part of the poeta, are quoted by Dillenbr.,
beginning with Ennius' inmens verses,—

“Nemo me lacrumis decoret neo fnners fletu
Ferit. cnr? Volito sivn’ per ore wirdm.''
llbinh ‘quern vocas' refers to some particular invitation of Maecenas, and that the ode
was ibe result of 0000 invitation, which opinion I 000 expressed before 1 met with Dil-
leubr.’s commenta on this ode inhia Qu. Hor. (1841, Bonn). He there treats it as aa
ntimo oi youthfnl spirito on the occasion of Maecenae' first invitation (000. i. 6). ’100
eoilbst ‘dilecte' implying long familiarity, is opposed to this rien, and Dillenbr. says
nothing sbont it in his edition oi Horace, though he there treats the ode ss a juvenda
