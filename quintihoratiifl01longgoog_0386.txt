HORA'HI mccl

serien III.

liciace appears to hare brought enemies upon himself hythe last Satireard pelops
by others, which have not been published. llis amiable temper was not very well omli·
fledfor that sort of writing, and we may infer from the present poem that herim
to olem himself from the imputation of a censorious spirit, end so to set himsdf rigi:
with Maecenas and his friends. The connexion between the two Satires isseen in tle
opening of thia, in which 'ligellius is again introduced and tho peculiarities of h'o che
ractcr described, for no other reason, as it would seem,but tc serre as a text forheds
course thet follows, on the duty of jndging others charitebly as we wish to be judprd
ourselvee. In tho course of his remarks on this subject Horace comes across twoof tte
Stoic absurditice= one that nll fanlts aro alilre (r. 96 squ), which he macte byth*
doctrine that expediency is almost the mother cf justice and equity3 and the othe
thet every wise man (thet is, every Stoic) is endoved with all the gitta of art aad
fortune from the skill of the mechanic to the power of a king. With ajest upon this
fully the Satine closes.

The character of Tigellius is happily described (“ Not one, bnt all mankind's φ’·
tome ''), and a tone of good feeling rnna throughout the Satire= The langusge iugenisl
and the sentimenta nmiable. The style is Homce's own, as we may suppose ’Μ tf
Lucilius, it is clear, wrne more after the fashion cf the second Satire. in which hie
freedom cf speech and licentions laugnage appear tc me to be aimed at without rho
power which he possessed of giving them pdnt and severity. No one who reads this
Satire wosrld wish to see Horace in the disguise of the other.

If there isbetween the two the connexion above supposed, the third Satire most bare
been written ot no great distance of time after the other. But it appears from c&
that he was now well acquainted with Maecenas, though not on the terma of intimos
which afterwards grew np between thom. On these ffounds it seems probsblc dn
the Satira was written about the end of suo. 716, es Kirchner supposes.

ARGUMENT.

dingere hare all one fault-thet they will never sing to their diendo when they ara
selred, and never leave off when they are not. This werthe case with ligelliu, the
most inconsistent man in the world Caesar himself could not induce him to sing
unless he chose ς when the iit was on him he would keep it up from the sm marae
to the dcssert; one moment in a hurry, another absurdly slow ς now rimantem
now with but ten3 one while talking big, another all hnmility; one while moini
with a little, another sqnnndering milliens ς up all night, snoring all day.

But what, have you no faultsl Yes, bnt perhaps not so bad aa bis. And pei lm
not like Maenius, who, while he exposed his neighbour’s faults, cuelly declsrcd bt

· made excuses for his own. Why should a man be blind to his own defecto and inve
an engle’s eye forts feuowvr ns may preme, ene enom mming ns atvs urm
him. Your friend we will say is a little hasty, and mucidus, and perhaps not very
polished3 but he is n good rnen, nnd kind to yon, and a man of genius withal ln
short, examine yourself, and sce what fanlts nature or neglect has sowa in 5⁰⁰1 m
