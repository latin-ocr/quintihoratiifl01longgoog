PREFACE. xvii

MS. for ‘ vetat,' but if this is so, the preponderance of the evidence
for ‘vetet' ought not absolutely to decide in this passage. There
are two objections to ‘vetat ε’ one is the form ‘Teque’ by which
this lineis connected with the preceding, which contains ‘ vivas ς’
and the other is the difficulty of being certain about the meaning of
‘hevns,’ which, as some critice suppose, signifies ‘infaustus' a Α
meaning which inconsistent either with ‘ vetet’ or ‘vetat’ If
‘laevus’ signifies ‘auspicious,' then we have with ‘vetat’ this
meaning, ‘And thee neither the auspicious woodpeeker nor the
wandering crow forbids to g0,’ which is plainly not sense. Ι am not

sure about the meaning of ‘ vaga,’ but I think it has an inauspicious
meaning. 'I'he passage is curicus, and it might be discussed before
a jury of competent men under the guidance of a judge, who would
prevent the advocates from quarrelling and ahusing one another, as '
critias do sometimes.

Mr. Maeleane observes that he has not accepted a single con·
jactare made by Bentley. These conjectures, it is said, amount to

uveral hundreda. As far as I know, very few cf Bentley's con·
jectures are now accepted by any editor 3 and this is a strong con·
damnation of a man's judgment whose great learning is acknow-
lodged. It seems as if Bentley made many of his conjectures first,
and then tried to find out reasons for them. Thosa who know him
only by his criticisms on Milton and his controversial writings,
such as the Boyle Lecture and Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, may be
curicus tolcam how he has handled a Latin poet in whom propriety

nl expression and good taste are conspicuous. If Bentley's Latin
notes were translated into English, men who are not scholars, but
have plain good sense, would find something of the same kind that
they might have seen before inhia English writings. It is true
that the notes on Horace did not allow him quite so good an oppor· .
tunityof venting his coarse wit and bad teste as his attaclr on the
Dienonrse on Prae-thinking by Antony Collina, the friend of John
lacha 3 but he has done enough in his Horace to show his great Ι
defects, and young men should ba warned against being deluded by
aprofnse display of learning, which is frequently used to support a

perverse ingenuity. Bentley's powers of assertion were strong: his
