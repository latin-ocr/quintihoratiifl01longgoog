PREFACE. ix

Prelace has laid down a scheme determining the dates of the several
books, without stating the grounds on which he louuds it. It
vill he seen that I prefer Elanke’s opinion on this subject to
Kirehner's, but that there are many instaures in which his acal

appears to outstrip his judgment in determining the date of
particular poema.

Of the other books that Ι have used I have been most indebted
toEstre's Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam, 1846), a most

When I have met with a quotation in any of the late commentatore
that appeared to have originated from himself,I have given his

quotation is only one of the common stock that has accumulated
from the Scholiasts downwards, Ι have given credit for it to no one,
hut do not on that account wish to have the credit of it mysell.
