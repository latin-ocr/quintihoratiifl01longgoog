GARMEN VIII.

'lha principle of identification has led co strange confusion aud inventione respoeiing
the usura mamad iu this ode. 1 find from Estre that ono aeholar has affirmed, ihai'by
Lydia Heraea meant J ulia, and by Sybaris Marcellus. The readerbas only lo compare
the odes iu which this name occurs, and he will form his own opinion. Hera thero is uo
sign of jaalouey‚ bui nuxieiy for ibe reputation ol Sybaris 3 in O. i. 13 ibere inviolent
jealcusy of Telephus 3 in iii. 9 there is a lover’s coquetiiug and reconciliation 3 while in
'aaa bydiais a worn-out prostituta looking lor lovers who will noi come. If we had
moreoi hunereon’a poetry to guido us, we should probably see such traces of the origin
ol all thena oties as would put ibe matter iu the right light. The name of Sybaris is
obviously intended to represent ilie character into which the youth has fallen.

ARGUMENT.

Lydia, why ari thou qioiling Sybaris ihus, so that ho shuns all manly exercisess He
rho was onoc so active, why does he no longer ride, aud swim, and wrastle, and
ibina the quoii and javalin in tha Campus Mustius? Why does he hide himself with
thee, like Achilles, ln woman's apparel i

Laura, die, per omnes

Te deos oro, Sybarin eur properas amando
Perdere 3 cur aprinum

oderit eampum patiens pulveris eique solie?
Cur neque militaris 5

Inter aequales equitat, Gallica nec lupatis
Temperat ora frenis?

Cur timet liavum Tiberim tangere? Cur olivum
Sanguine viperino

Caulius vitat, neque jam livida gestat armis ιο
Brachia saepe diseo,

Saepe trans finem jaculo nobilis expedito?
Quid latet, ut marinae

Filium dicuni Thetidis sub lacrimosa Trojae
Funera ne virilis 16

Cultus in caedem ei Lycias proriperei catervas?
