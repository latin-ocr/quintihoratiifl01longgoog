400 HORA'HI FLACCI

In magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avito

Ex re praeberi sumptus mihi credemt illos.

Nec timuit sibi ne vitio quis verteret· olim si
Si praeco parvas ant, ut fuit ipse, coactor

Mercedes sequerer ς neque ego essem questus: et hoc nnnc
Laus illi debetur et e me gralia major.⁴

Nil me poeniteat sanum patris hujus, eoque

Non, ut magna dolo factum negat esse suo pars ιι
