Fauorinus Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,
Si recte frueris, non estut copia major

Ab J ovedonari possit tibi. rI'olle querelas ς
Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus.
Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil
‘Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis
Vivis ct urtica, sic vives protinus ut te
Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret 3
Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit,

Vel qnia cuncta putas nna virtute minora.
Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos

Cultaque dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox 3
Oum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri
