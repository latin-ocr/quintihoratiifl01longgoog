twenty, it was in auc. 709, the year before C. Julius Caesar was assas·
sinated. After that event Brutus aud Cassius left Rome and went to
Greece. Foreseeing the struggle that was before them, they got round
them many of the young men at that time studyiug at Athens, and
Horace was appointed a tribune² in Brutus' army, a high command, for
which he was not qualified. He went with Brutus into Asia Minor,
and finally shared his defectat Philippi, auc. 712. He makes humouous
allusion to this defeat in his Ode to Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After the
battle he came to Italy, having obtained ‘permission to do so, lilre many
others who were willing to give up a desperate cause and settle quietly
ethome. His patrimony⁸, however, was forfeited, and hs seems to
have had no means of subsistenoe, which indnoed him to employ himself
in writing verses, with the view perhaps of bringing himself into notice'
rather than for the purpose of making money by their sale. It is not
impossible, however, that some of his earliest compositione were savem
personul satires and lampeons, written at the instigation of those who
were able to pay him for them. That the boolr of Epodss which we
possess does not eontain all that he wrote in Archilochus’ vein, I think
is pretty cartain3 and the aame'I believe may be said of the books of
Satires. Probably his earliest efforts were more severe and lieentious
than those which his judgment allowed him afterwards to publish,
though some of these are bad enough. With Archilochus and Lucilius
before him as models, and without the experienoe he afterwards gained,
his earliest productions may without difficulty be supposed to have been
such as in later life he would condemn. By some means he managed
to get a place as scriba¹ in the Quaestor’s office, whether by purchaae
or interest does not appear. In either case we must suppose he con·
trived soon to make friends, though he could not do so by tha course
he pursued without also making many enemies. His Satires are full of
allusione to the enmity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted, among other literary persons, with Virgil and
Varius, who about three years alter his return (auc. 715) introduced
him to Maecenas, who was careful of receiving into his circle Brutus'
tribune, and one whose writings were of a kind that was new and un.
popular. He accordingly saw nothing of Horace for nine months after
his introduction (S. i. 6. 61). He then sent for him (auc. 716), and from
that time continued to be his patron and friend. There is nothing

⁹ Kirahner (Qu. Hor. p. 15, n. 4) and Franks (fast. Hor. p. 20) reject this notiora,
supposing Horace to mean in the passage on which it isfounded (llpp. ii. 2. 61) that
poverty made him desperate and mrelesa of consequences, but that when ba hecnam

comparatively rich hs lost that stimulus.
