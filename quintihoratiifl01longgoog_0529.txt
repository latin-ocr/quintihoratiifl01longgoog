Aedificas, hoe est, longos imitaris ab imo

Ad summum totus moduli bipedalis, et idem
Corpore majorem rides 'lhirbonis in armis

Spiritum et incessum: qui ridiculus minus illo?

Au quodcunque facit Maecenas te quoque verum est
’10111010 dissimilem et 10010 certare minorem?
Absentis ranae pullis vituli pede pressis,

Unus ubi effugit, matri denarrat ut ingens

Belua cognatos eliserit. Illa rogare:

Quantane? num tantum, sufflans se, magna fiiisset?
Major dimidio. Num tanto? Cum magis atque
Se magis inflaret, Non si te ruperis, inquit,

Par eris. Haec ate 0011 multum abludit imago. . 010
Adde poemata nunc, hoc est, oleum adde camin03
Quae si quissimus feeit sanus facis et tu.
