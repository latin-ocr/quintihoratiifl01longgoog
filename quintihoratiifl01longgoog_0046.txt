HORATII nuncet

Seu rupit teretes Marsus aper plagas.
Me doctarum hederae praemia trontium
Dis miscent superis; me gelidum nemus 30
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori
Secemunt populo, si neque tibias

. Euterpe cohibet nec Polyhymnia
Lesboum refugit tendere barbiton.
Quodsi me lyricis vatibus inseris, ³5
Sublimi feriam sidem vertice.
