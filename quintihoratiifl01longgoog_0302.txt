262 HORATII FLACCI

Magnus Διιιι was generally believed iu iscertaiu. Virgil refers to ιι in his fourth ·
ltclogue: ‘⁴ Magnus eb integro saeclorum nascitur ordo'' (v. t), ‘⁸ incipient magui pne
cedere meuses'' (v. 12). Cicero discusses it in his trectise de Nat. Deorum (throp
“Quarum (t. e. of the planete) ex disparibus motionibus msgmm annum murmuri

inter se comparationem confectis omnium spatiis est facta conversio. Ques quem lmgr

of the sncieuts vary dom 49,000 to uesrly 26,οω years. The last ecmponds ιο ιιι
period calculated for the preoessiou of the squinones, with which, however, the lingum
Atinas of the Greeks and Romans hed nothing ιο ιο. It is represented uu the reverse
of ι medal cf Hadrian in ιιι form of a man iu a loose robe, with a globe ιιι hornis
in his lest hand, and his right raised over his head. He is surrouuded by ιι ond ring
to distinguish him from the figures of Eteruity, represented iu a circle. 'l'he iuscrip

explanation, which ere derived chiefly from the statemeuts of Servius on the «ιιι liciogae ·
of Virgil aud from Censorinus, de Die Natali, 1 cannot say. But, without rcscrting to
such explanatione ιι ιιι above, it would heve been vcry surprising if Augustis, hsdug
resolved ιο celebrate a great festival in honour of his owu successful career, had ιιι ,
made Apollo the principal feature of it, ιιι ιιι called upon Pluto tohless his country· '
in preference to that god ιο whom he allowed himself tc be likeued ιιι whom his
datterers assigned tobim as his father. Horace appears to heve been much plsassd ιι
being choseu ιι poet-laureato of the occasion (C. iv. 6, Introd.). 'fhe ode was sung ti
the most solemn part cf the festival, while the emperor wesin person offeriug nrrifioe
attho second bour of tbe night οι ιιι river side upon three sltsrs, attended byrts
fifteen meu who presided over religious affsirs. The chorus consisted of twentyserru
boys aud twenty-seven girls of noble birth, well trained ιο doubt for the seorsim
(O. iv. 6). 'l'be effect musthave been very beautiful, end ιο wonder if the impensu

Attempts have been mede ιο distinguish the parts assigned to the respective etum
But there ιο not appesr ιο me ιο ιι any conclusive or very probable dats cn which to
found an accurate division, in which therefore, ιι might be expected, ιιι editors do ιιι
agree. 1 have endeavoured iu ιιι argument to show all the divisione of the ode by its
subjecte· In judging of the character of the ode ss ι poetical composition, it mast ιιι
ιι forgotten that it was written for s peculias aud solemn occasion and to be set ιο
music, in both which points it differs from most of the other odes of Horace ς aujourd
with reference to those objects, it may be pronounced superior ιο ιιιιιιιι edesio
