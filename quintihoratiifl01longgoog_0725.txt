EPISTOLARUM ΙΙ. 2. 685

Nescio quod cupiens hortari coepit eundem ³5
Verbis quse timido quoque possent addere mentemr
“I ,bone, quo virtus tus te vocet, ι pede fauste,
Grandis laturus meritorum praemis. Quid stas?’'
Post haec ille cetus quantumvis rusticus: “ Ibit,
Ibit eo quo vis qui zonam perdidit, ” inquit.

Romae nutriri mihi contigit, atque doceri

Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.

Adjecere bonae paulo plus ortis Athenae,

Scilicet ut vehem curvo dignoscere rectum,

Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum.

Dure sed emovere loco me tempore grato,
civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in erma

Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.
