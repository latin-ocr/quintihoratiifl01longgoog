When we have long been accustomed tc a reading, itis very dif-
1001110 accept another, even if there is better evidence 100 it, and
good reasons. Thus in (1.11. 20. 13, Keller has ‘jam Daedaleo
notior Icaro! Ihardly know whether ‘ocior' or ‘notior’ 10 sup· ,
ported by the better evidence. Perhaps ‘notior' is 3 and 11 we

accept it, we escape the ‘Daedaleo ocior? Still partly from habit, .

and partly 100 01100 reasons, Ι am not yet reconciled 10 ‘ notior!

In C. iii. 4. 9, ‘altricis extra limen Apuliae,’ the question 01
‘Apuliae' is hotly debated. The word ‘ Apuliae’ following ‘Apulo'
is not the kind 01 repetition which seems to me 10 10 00 argument
against ‘Apuliae ς’ 000 10 110 argument derived 'from the qnan-

case in which 0011100 may differ ; 101 ‘Apuliae' is now generally
condemned. 'l'here 10 0 0010 00 1110 passage.

‘she boldest attempt at alteration that I lrnow is in (1. 111. 24. 4:
‘ Tyrrhenum omne tuis 01 mare Apulicum,’ where Keller has ‘ter-
renum omne tuis et mare publicum,' and Ritter has ‘Tyrrhenum
omne 1010 01 mare Ponticum! Bentley has said 'nothing against
the common reading. ‘Terrenum’ is Lachmann's. Itis quite plain
that Horace, according tc his fashion, would use 0 proper name here,
and theMSS. have ‘Tyrrhenum' or some equivalent form. Ithink
it ia equally plain that the verse would end with some other proper
name, and ‘Ponticum’ is supplied by some manuscripts. Others
have ‘pulicum’ ‘ publicum,’ ‘apulicum,' ‘punicum’ Here 10 0

with the ‘Tyrrhenum' 11110 difficulty about ‘Apulieum’is in·
