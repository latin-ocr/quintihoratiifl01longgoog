GARMEN IV.

suthe positive information we can derivo from this ode in respect to the purport and
1111111, that it 11111111 1 vehement invective against some person 11 low birth oud con-
tenptibls character, who gave himself sira and disguated the people of Roma: he was
siros military tribuna. 'l'he approximate tirneis 111111 by tha 1111 lines, which show
1111 it was written while Caesar 0111111111 was preparing or carrying on war against
Sertm Pompeius, who had enlistsd iu his service pirates and slaves, 11 we learn from
Ilion (19. 1. 1-12. See below, 1110). To bring us nearer to the exactdate‚ it has been
argued (1111 by 11111111 iu his life of Horace) that, 1111111111 aa in the second expedition
11111111 against Sex. Pompeius there were eulistod iubis 1111 1 great body of 111111, 11
11111 probable 11111 Horace would have used language of contempt which would apply as
noch lo Caesu's as the enemy’s force. It must therefore have been written, if this
corruption harany weight, before thatarmament was formed, which was auc. 717. In

ixed upon instead of ‘ Menaa’ though no attempt is made to identify him with 11111111-

But that argument, which is Gesner’s, has no great force. Horace meantto attnck the
mggertng sirs of the man, which were more 11111111 to the citizens than his betrayal
of Pompeius, by which they had gained, ond which could not hove been noticed without
offenffing Caesar. 2. That Menas hod been so short 1 time in Rome, that he could not

short hmpoon. 1111111 111111 was 11111 eques. But be wos elevated to that rank by
