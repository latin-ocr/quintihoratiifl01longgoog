EPISTOLARUM Ι. 17. 635

Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.
Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum
Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbuere,
Aut cistam effractam et subducto vietiee plorat,
Noto refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam,
Saepe periscelidem ruptum sibi flentis, uti mox
Nullo fides domnis verisque doloribus adsit.

Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curut
Fracto crure plnnum, licet illi plurimo manet
Lacrima, per sunctum juretus dicat Osirim:

“ Creditesnon lud03 crudeles, tollite claudum.”
“ Quaere peregrinum,'’ ricinia reuco reclamat.
