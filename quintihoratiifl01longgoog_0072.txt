32 HORATII FLACCI

ΟΑΒΜΕΝ XII.

ane. reta-729.

Marcellus married J ulia, the daughter of Augustus, ano. 729, and died 731. rra
allusion in v. 45 ofthis ode makes it quite cemain that it was written before the daath
ol Marcellus, and atter he had attained an again which he could gira promise ol sas·
taining the distinction cl his name. 'l'he meaning of that stanaaia plainly this: “ The
larue cf the house of Marcellus, taking its birth from the great Claudius the victor ol
Syracuse, is growing up through successive generations like the insensible growth or* a
trec, and promises to come to maturity in Octavia's son.” Franks thinks theodosus
written before Augustus wcnt against the Cantabrians in 729, and about the time of
Marcellns’ marriage, when he was only in his eightecnth year. Others placa it aster
Angustus’ return from Spain in ann. 730, and the closing ol the temple of Janns l
think with Franks some allusion to this event would have been made had the ode been
written then. Torrentius thinks it was one of those hymns which by order of the Senate
(according to Dion Cassius) were addressed to Augustus, as a god, astar the battle ol
Actium. At that time Marcellus was in hia lonneenth year, hut sven then Angustm
was very fond of him and had great hopes othim. 'l'he poam has much ol the appear·
unce ol an ode sor music, hut a hymn composed on the maaian Torrentius supposes
could hardly have failed toallude to tha successes it was intendedto celebrata. 1 preter
Franke’s opinion to the others ; but there is no possibility ln my jndgment ot' flaing the
date precisely. auc. 729 appears tc ba tha latest year to which it cau be properly

assigned, and 725 the earliest.
'l'ha opening is taken from the second Olympic ode of Pindar, which begins-

ἂναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
riva θεόν, rlr’ ipen, riva δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν ,-
But tha rest ol tha oda seems to be original. Pindar aska whom he shall sing, and
immediately sings of Theron. Horace, thorigh he makes Angustus the climax of his
song, goes through the praises of J ove and his children, and thenas twelvc of Rome's
principal worthies, before he comes to Augustus. 'l'he common inscriptions, therefore,
“an Aucusrusr,” or ‘⁴ nn Anopsr0,'' do not seem to express tha scope of this ode,
which is ratberto celebrata the popular divinitics and heroes of Βοωο than Angustus
exclusively ς though this design is so worked out aa to draw the chief attention to him.

ARGUMENT.

Whom wilt thou sing among gods or men, Clio? Whose name shall the echocs ot' ’
Helicon or Pindus repcat, or of Haemus whose woods followed the swsat mnne of
Orpheus? Whom before the almighty Father, who knows no equal or second? Alter ο
him cometh Pallas and then bravo Liber, and tha buntress Dirma, and Phoebus tha ,
archer, and Herculea and Iaeda's sons, the horscman and the fighter, bet'ore whose i
star the tempestslly. Thau shall it be Romulus, or tha peaceful Numa, or proud'
Tarquin, or Cato that nobly died? Regulus, and the Scauri, and Paulus, who gare
up his grean soal to the Carthaginien gratefnlly, lwill sing, and Fabricius, and Curius, ,
and Camillus, all trained lor war iu porerty·’s school. 'l'he farne ol Marcellus ia grow- ,
ing up insensihly like atrae, and tha star of Julius is brighterthan all nara Το thee,
great l‘athar, ia gran the care of caesara share with him thy kingdom. Putting
Parthians to llight and subduing the natione ol the Euat, he shall rule the world ss
thy vicegerent with a rightcons away, while thou dost shake Olympus and hurlest

 

thy bolts upon tha mnata os impiety. j
