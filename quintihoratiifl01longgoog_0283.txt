CARMINUM IV. 9. 213

Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas
Obliviones. Est animus tibi
Rerumque prudens et secundis 35
Temporibus dubiisque rectus,
Vindex avarae fraudis, et abstinens
Ducentis adse cuneta pecuniae,
Consulque nen unius anni
Sed quoties bonus atque fidus ⁴0
Judex honestum praetulit utili,
Rejceit altu dona nocentium

Vultu, per obstantes catervas
Explicuit sna victor arma.
