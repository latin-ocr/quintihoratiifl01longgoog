SATIRARUM I. 10.

Ergo non satis est risu diducere rictum

Auditoris; et eet quaedam tamen hio quoque virtue.
Est brevitate opus, ut currat sententia neu se
Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures3

Et sermone opus est modo tristi saepe jocoso,
Defendente vicem modo rhetoris atque poetae,
Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus atque
Extenuantis eas consulto. Ridiculum acri

Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat ree.

Illi scripta quibus comoedia prisca viris est

Hoc stabant, hoc sunt imitandi ς quos neque pulcher
Hermogenes unquam legit neque simius iste
