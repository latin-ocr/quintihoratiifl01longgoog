What you eall a desert 1 eall a beautiful laudscaps, aud what you thinlr beautiful l
dislilre. Yon long for the brothel and greasy tarem, aud daucing to awautou’s

Vrnnrcr silvarum et mihi me reddentis agelli,
Quem tu fastidis habitatum quinque focis ct
Quinque bonos solitum Variam dimittere patrm,
Certemus spinas animone ego fortius an tu
Evellas agro, et melior sit Horatius an res.

Me quamvis Lamiae pietas et eura moratur
Fratrem maerentiS, rapto de fratre dolentis
Insolubiliter, tamen istuc mens animusque

Fert et amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra.

Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum ;
cui placet alterius sua nimirum est odio sore.
Stultus uterque locum immeritum causatur inique:

In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam. ·
