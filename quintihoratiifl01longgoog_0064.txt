HORA'PII FLACCI

OARMEN VII.

L. Munatius Plancus, who followed C. J nlius Caesar both in Gaul and in his war with
Pompey‚ after Caesar's death attached himself to the republican party, but very soon
afterwards joined Augustus ς then followed Antouyto the llast, and auc. 722, the year
before Aetium, joined Augustus again. It 11 supposed that about this time, perhaps at
the suggestion of Augustus, who was anxious to secure Plancus and to keep him imm
leaving Italy, Horace wrote him this ode while his mind was perplered and he was
perhaps meditating retirement from Rome to Greeee.

l think all this is very doubtful, and with 111116 (p. 308) 1 cannot but think it uncer- .

tain whether this Plancus is intended at all. It may have been his son, who is probably
the Munatius referred to in Epp. i. 3. 31, or some other Plancus. But even if the father
be the man, 1 eannot see any such serious purpose in the ede aethe above theory im·
plies, nor do 1 believe Augustm attached any such velue 10 the renegade's 1111111100.
Ηο appears to have been a contemptible person. Thatthe temple 01 lanus wasnot

, closed at the time is true (v. 20); but that does not fix the date before the battle of

Actium. Ithink the name of Plancus is again used more aa aeouvenienee than any
thing else, though there is perhaps a little more individuality given to this ode than to
the fourth. 'l‘he story 01 Teucer has all the appearance 01 a Greek origin.
L. Munatius Plancus, abuuereferred to, was consul in ano. 712. See C. 11114. 27.
“ Non ego hoe ferrem, calidus juventa,

Consule Planeo.”

ARGUMENT.

Let others sing of the noble eities of Graece, and dedicate their lives 10 the celebration
of Athens and all its glories. For my part 1 care not for Lacedaemon and lamara,
as for Albunea's cave, the banks of Anio, and the woods and orehards 01 Tibur. 'l'he
sky is not marsya dark, Plancus—droun care in wine, whether iu the camp or in
the shades of Tibur. As Teucer, though driven hom his father’a home, bourffl
poplar on his head and oheefcd his companium, saying, ‘¹ Let us follow fortune, my

' fuends, kinder than a father: despair not while Teucer is your chief ς Apollo bas

promised us another Salamis 3 droun care in wine, for to·morrow we will seek the

deep once more.”
