SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 4. 491

de se ipso, Haec primus invenit et cognovit Catina Miltiadee.” Hedoes not seem how·
eser to have obserred that Catius is only representing the words of his teacher. But
as this person must have been dead many years before this Satire was written (Cicero’s
letter was written ΑΜ. 709), ithae been supposed by some that Horace introduces his
name, though hs was no longer living, only as a handle for ridiculing the Epicuresns.
Orelli suggests that Horace's Catius was afreedman ot Cicero's Catius, and a con·
temptible person, notorious as s writer on eoolrery. Certainly a well-known name
would answer every purpose even if the owner were dead, and the former of these two
opinions is probably correct.

'l'hat Horace chose a well-known Epicurean aa the speaker in this gastronomical
Satirc, seems to show that he no longer held with that sect when he wrote it (C. i. 343
S. i. 5. 101). Tbat the followers of Epicurus went beyond their master in commending
sensual delights may very well be believed. It is usually the fate of unsound teachera
tlrat their errors are exaggerated by those who profess to adopt them. It appears that
Epicurus held πολυτελῆ virsa to be only secondnry pleamrm, ola drepanius: that he
held a man should be ableto do without them, though if lae could afford them he would
do well to have them3 and indeed thot be had a good opinion even of footing (Diog.
laert. x. 127-149). But his Roman adherente did not take that view ol* their duty,
aud under the sanctiones his name and school made good living the chief good, and the
art os cookery the art of lise (see Introduction ιο S. 2 of this boolr).

Ponere signa novis praeceptis, qualia vincant
