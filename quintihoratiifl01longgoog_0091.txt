CARMINUM 1. 21.
GARMElN XXI.

lhe year after Augustus returned to Rome from the taking of Alexandria, thetis
nme. 726, he dedicamd a temple toApollo on the Palatina hill (C. i. 31), and instituted
quinquennial gamas in honour of Apollo and Diana, and called thern the ‘Ludi Actiaci'
for their first celebration Franks supposes Horace ιο have written this ode, and Cru-
quius’ Scholiast beura him out by a remark which, though by acme confusion it has got
transferred tutha saecular ode, belongs plainly to thie. The scholiasta end some commen·
tators following them believed this ode to be aa introduction ιο the saecular. Sanadon,
ou rhum our translator francis pinned his faith, held that opinion, and placed them
together, and ao does the translator. anke’s opinionis rendered doubtful hythe word
‘principe’ (v. 14), for Augustus did not get that title till the ides of January, alac.
remunerasse after the first celebration of the Actian gamas. Others refer this ode
tna later year, 7³2, when, as we learn from Dion Cassius (liv. 1), Rome was visited by
pestileuce aad famine. It is more likely, ss Orelli remarks, ιο have been an exercise
tum fancy suggested by some such festival as that of 726. It has not the dignity or
parumn of an ode written for such a special occasion.
