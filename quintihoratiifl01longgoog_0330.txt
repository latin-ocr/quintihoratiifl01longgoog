100 HORATII FLACCI

Quin nbi perire jussus exspiravero,
Nocturnus occurram Furor

Petamque vultus umbre curvis unguibus,
Quae vis deorum est menium,

Et inquietis assidens praecordiis
Pavore somnos auferam.

Vos turbs vicatim hinc et hinc suxis petens
Contrmdet obscoenas enus 3

Post insepulta membre different lupi
Et Esquilinae alites3 100

Neque hoc parentes hen mibi superstites
Effugerit spectaculum.
