“Ad Pompilium Varum scribit gaudens ob ejus in patriam reditum quem commilito·
uem in eastris Bruti et cassii fuisse commemorat ι et belli civilis evasisse pericula
Augusto sictone?³ These are the words of Acron, and many of the MSS. have ‘sn
Porsrmuu' or ίΡοιιιιιῐιιι Vanum? the latter being correct. But Sonadou, iol-
losed hy nearlyall commentatam till the last few years, hoa consounded the person here
addressed with Pompeius Grosphus (G. ii. 16), whois nlso mentioned in Epp. i. 12. 22.
But the proscribet! follower of Brutus cannot be identified with tha weolthy Grosphus,
as lore hus ohserved; and, ssVauderbnrg has remarked, the nearly made citizen would
not hara been addreaeed iu the language here used: ‘⁴ Quis te redonavit Quis-item Dis
patriisltoloqsse caelo.'’ Masron (Vie d’Horaoe, p. 88 sq.)li1es the dateiu mmo. 715,
in which year those of the republican party who had followed Sextus Pompeius were
allowed to return, peoccbeing made between Sextus and the triumvirs, aud an amuoety
being granted to his followera. Kirchner (Q. Η. pt) strongly supporte this opinion..
Dicor asks why then Horace should heve used the irords “Quis to redonavit'' &ei
md though the worda must nothe taken too literally aa s question, and are more sm
exprenion osJoyiol surprise, yet thera is something in the remark 3 and moreover it is
pretty certain that Horace when he wrote was in possession ethis country-house, aud
lad hom iu it some time (ιι. 19, 20). Βιι he did not get this house till aster the ilrst
leot ιι Satires was flnished, thot is not till mue. 720, and it may have been a year or
tuo later. The long nervice ol Pompeiue (mentioued in ι. 18) is inconsistent with th'e
above early dnte; aud something may be said iu respect to tha style of the ode, which
isone of Horace’s best. ano it is doubtful, eo it appears to me, whether even in jest
floraco would have alluded to Philippi iu the wey he hero does, if he were writing soon
aaa ιιιι memorable disaster. On theothole, it ia moet prohohle thot-Pompeius did
mtrem to Rome, ae Acron in'timates, till ester the evil wer uua over, having meau-
shile followed the iortuues lirst of his namesake Sextum sud then of M. Antonius, and
that the ode was written nno. 724, or thereabouts,
