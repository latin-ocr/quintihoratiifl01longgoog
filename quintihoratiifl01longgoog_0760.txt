720 HORA'PII rnnccl

Non laudem merui. Vos exemplaria Graeca
Nocturna versate manu, versate diurne.¹

At vestri proavi Plautinos et numeros et
laudavere sales: nimium patienter utrumque
Ne dioam stulte mirati, si modo ego et vos
Scimus inurbanum lepido seponere dioto
Legitimumque sonum digitis callemus et aure.
ignotum tragicae genus invenisse Camenae
Dicitur et plaustris vexisse polimate Thespis,
Quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ors.
Post huno personae pallaeque repertor honestae .
