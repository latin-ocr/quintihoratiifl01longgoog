jodgmeut in respect ιο deceased aud living authors, the former of whom they cess·
mended only beccum they were dead end gone, while the latter they ahused through '
anvy aud spite. 'lbere is something in this complaint which corresponds with his ,
censure of Lucilius and his admirere written many years before. But Lucilius does not ι
appear in this poem, in which the dramatic writers ars those more particularly notisud.
lt appears that Angustus was very partini ιο these himself, and Horace probably mesos
indirectly to remonstrats with the emperor’s taeta in this matter, and ιο put in ι pls-s
for himself and his hrethren, though that this was not necessary is plain from Angusta-¹
generosity ιο Virgil and Varius, noticed in v. 235, and from the intimacyou the strength
of which he was enablsd ιο write ιο ιιι great man at all in this strain. 'l'oe parts ιι
ιιι lipistls do not hang together very closely, especially after the first ninety linea
'l'hey consist of oompliments ιο Angustum a remonstwmce about ιιι μιιοιιιςι
bestowed on the old pcets3 a description of the rapid gmwth of art in Grecos altu ιιι
Peneion war; a complaint that every body at Rome has taken ιο wsiting resen s
commendation of poets as good and nseful citizens and contributum ιο ιιι mh'ml
piety ς a history of the growth of poetry in Italy3 a comparison betreen tngedy aud
comedy, and a sneer at Piontns and another ς an account of the troubles of dumus
authors through the caprice and bad taste of their audience, which at that tima is ,
stated ιο have been especially depraved; an appeal ιο Angustus on behalf of the psets ¹
of the dsy; and a rsproof to such poets as are unreasonable or officiosa and aflupt ¹
themes too exulted for them.

. How much foundation there may have been for Horace's remarks about the compan- ,
tivo support given ιο ιιι old writers and the new it is hard to say. 'l’oere appears to
be a little contradiction between this alleged neglect aud the universal ragc for scrin-
bliog which he describes ; or else the profusion of bod verses may itself account tir
tha preference of those, who did not write, for the genius of former days. Horace ιιι
not a word ιο say for Plautus or for Terence, hut rather sneers at the popular y'udgmcnt
of them. We may safely say therefore that this Epistle is worth nothing in point
of criticism, and that it does not raise Horace very high as a guida ιο ιιι uste of
others. It is possible an affectation of preference for the archaic in langnaga may
have prevailed in some qnartcrs3 bot Horace's censure affecta those who oo round
principles of teste preferred the rigonr of theold writers ιο ιιι weakncss of the nes.
In short, there is no discrimination in his statement of the case; in which ιιαιιοιιΙ
do not findit easy ιο follow him.

Tharais much polish ιι the versificat' tion of this Epistle. 'l'he flattery with which⁸ n
opens is cleverly written, and the verses towards the end,' ιιι which Horace oompsndioasly Ἴ
states the military successes of Angustus, are tersa and elegant. liis commendatior
of the poet' rs a fair tribute ιο his own profession. 'I'he description of the vulgar ιιιιε ι
for spectacles' ιι natural, and reminds us of our own times, and there' rs enough' m ιιι l
Epistle ιο ιοοοοιιι for the high estimation it is held in by the generd ruder. Ἴ

“ ARGUMENT.

It would be nnpardonable in me to detain you, 0 Caesar, absorbed as yon are in the
weightiest cares. Romulus and Liber, the sons of heda aud Hercules, those ιιι»
factors of mankind, received not while alive the honour dua to their great desds:
they were envied then, but ars worshipped now, for greatness scorcbss those heb*
it ι bnt when its light is removed, then it is admired. Το you, on the other lund.
we render our homage, even while you are with ns, ond acknowisdga that your opust
has not been, aud never shall hs.

(ι. 18.) Βοι they who are hersin so wisa, are not wisc in thia that they like nothinf:
but whatis gono. Such admirere ara they of what is old that they declara des xil
Tables of the laws, tha old kings’ treatias, ιιι pontifical books, and tha rums· 0¹
