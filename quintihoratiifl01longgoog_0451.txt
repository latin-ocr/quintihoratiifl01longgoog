Oa the outaide cf the city walls, in frent of Mons Esquilinus lay the Campus Esqui-
linus, iu which was a public burtel-ground for the poorest of the people, and the place
of execution for slaves and others of the lorrer sort, whose bodies nera left unburied for
the daga and vultures to prey upon (Epod. v. 100). This place, which must always
herc been a public uuisance aud a source of melaria, was given (as some say) by a decree
of the senate to Maecenas, or else purchased by him, cleared, drained, and laid cut in
gardana, in which he afterwards built a handsome house (Ο. iii. 29. -Epod ix, xlv.
Introduction. S. ii. 3. 309). His example was afterwards followed by a member of
the house of Lamia, in whose gardens Caligula was buried (Suet, Calig. c. 59). 'I'he
following Satira was suggested by a figure of Priapus set up in Maecenas’ gardam 'l'he
god is represented as connecting the present state of the ground with what it once was,
by which a cumpliment is convcyed to Maecenas for his public spirit ia ridding the
city of anch a nnisance. Priapus also complains of the trouble he has in lreeping the
ground clear of trespassers, but more particularly of the witches, who, haring formerly
carried ou their practices among the tombs and bones of the dead, continued to haunt
the scene of their iniquity. Thia is introduced for the purpose of dragging in the
noman whom Horace satirized under the name cf Canidia. The description is in some
parts very like that of the fifth'lipode, and the tvvo may have been written about the
same dms lt is not very likely Horace would have maintained his warfaru with this
woman, whoerer she was or whatever her chance, for several years Kirchner (Qu.
Hor. p. 16), because in S. ii. 3. 312 reference is made to Maecenas aa engaged in build-
iug, places these two Satires in consecutive years, this being written aue. 721 (lutro-
ductiou to Epod. ι). But there is not much in this argument. 'I'he clearing, drein-
ing, and enclosing of the ground must have taken some dms, and it may have
been several years before it was fit for living cn, and no reference is made to a house in
this Satira. Prauke places ir in aue. 718. There isvery little clue to the date.
