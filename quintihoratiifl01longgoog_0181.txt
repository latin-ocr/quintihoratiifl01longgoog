CARMINUM ΙΙΙ. 2. 141

Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae
Intaminatis fulget honoribua
Nec sumit aut ponit secures
Arbitrio popularia aurae.
Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
Coetusque volgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna.
Est et fideli tuta silentio
Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve mecum
