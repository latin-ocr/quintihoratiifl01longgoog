CARMINUM III. 12.

Non times detur 3 socerum et scelestas
Falle sorores, 4ο

Quae velut nactae vitulos leaenae

Singulos eheu lacerant: ego illis

Mollior neo te feriam neque intra
Claustra tenebo.

Me pater saevis oneret catenis

Quod viro clemens misero peperci ;

Me vel extremos Numidarum in agros
Classe releget.

I pedes quo te rapiunt et aurae

Dum favet nox et Venus, i seeundo

Omine et nostri memorem sepulcro

Scslpe querelam.

OARMnN XII.

l'nis ode represents a girl lamenting to herself over aiore she must not indulge. 'I'ne
nujoritg of editions hare supposed that the poet is himself addressing Neobule, and
hmbinua says, “haee ode eat παραινετική sen προτρεπτική, id est ad suadendum et ex·
laundun? the meaning of which is not very clear. 'l'ho way 1 understand the first
stanna and its connexion with the second may be seen from the Argnment. Some sup·
poee that Neobnlo is contrasting her own condition with that of others. ‘Miserable are
tha women who oannot indulge in lore and wine; for thee, Neobule‚ it is otherwise! 1
do not quarrel with that interpretation, but prefer the other. There is a fragment of
liorem (58 Bergk) that may have belonged to s poem which furnished tho materiale
of this ode. Some have assumed it to bea free translation ¹from Aloaens’ poem. There
‘u nothing more to judge from than thia fragment, which runs thus: ἐμὲ δείλη, tal
mir maror aadtxoaw, which line, as far as it goes, is in favour of the interpre-
utta l have given.
