(1.1. 3.-Τ111 11 another 11 the Asclepiadem metues, consisting 11 J
two verses alternating thus: ¹

-ΞΙ-υυΙ-υῦ
--Ι-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υο

The first 11 11111 verses is called after Glycon, a poet whose age and

birtbplace are unknown. The second verse is the same as C. i. l. Τ1
this metra also belong C. i. 13.19. 36;111. 9. 15. 19. 24, 25. 28;

iv. 1. 3.

Ο. i. 4.-Tbis metra has its name 111111 Archilochus 11 Paros. 11
consisto 11 alternate verses, 11 which the 1111111 11111 those that the
grammaticus call docva'prmoc', because they consist 11 different mea·
sures which do not blend together. The 11111 four feet are those 11 an
hexameter verse, 11111 which follow three trocheea, the first part being
always distinct 111111 the second. The second 111 catalectic iambic
trimeter, that is, it 111111 syllable wanting in the last 1111. There is
no other Ode in this metra.

C. i. 5.-Tbis is also reckoued with the Asclepiadean matres, though

only the two first lines have their name 111111 Asclepiades, being the ¹
same as C. l. The third is called after Pherecrates, the comio poet 11 ζ
Athens. It consiste 11 1 daotyl between two spondeos, 11 my ear does
not deceive me3 but it 11 usual 11 mark it with a spondes, choriambus,
and long syllable. The 11111111 11 111 Glyconean verse, which occurs in

Ο. 3. To this matrs belong C. i. 14, 21, 235 iii. 7, 133 iv. 13.

and perhaps in the line 11 Heracus
‘Quindecim Diana preces virorum!

11 Horace baa generally avoided this form 11 111 verse, the dislilre seems 11 bave been
diminished as hia ear improved3 11 that while therela but one instance 11 such a
caesura in the second bools of the Carmina, aud not one in tbe third, there are no 1111
than twenty-two in tbe fourth, and in the Carm. Saea one on an averagein every 1111111.
Nuy, even in such lines as ‘Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae’ we prefer tbe double
trocbee nocent at the commencement to that which Dr. Carey considers 11 awest, who
virtually makes ‘chorus' 1 trachea, and would, we suppose, give the sonnd 11 a dactyl to
1111111111 in ‘Romulae genti date remque prolem Ι que nt decus omne? Isany one will
read ovar the C. S. with the accent we contend 111, 11 will readily perccive the beauty
of 111 matre, and cenae to wonder that Sappho and Catullus hesitated not to malse the
fourth syllable short. In particular much beauty will beaddcd 11 tbe line ‘J sm Fides
et Pax et Honos Pudorque) According 11 Dr. Carey'a 11111111 11 1 metricat accent,
‘Pax’ will lose all emphasis.”
