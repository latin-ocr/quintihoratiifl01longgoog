possunt'.” Nor do 1 think he is much more happy, in most in-
stances (especially in the Odes), in his choica of readings than in ¹
his conjectures. He was always liable to be misled by want 01 ear
and poetical testeae well as by the excess 01 a prurient sagacity
andan unbounded egotism. 'l'he text in this edition will be found to
differ less from Orelli's than from any other. Where it does so the
reason is, l think, always given in the 00100. He collated some
excellent MSS, especially three in the library at Berne, 01 which
the oldest he places at the end 01 the eighth century or the be·
ginning of the ninth, and the other two in the tenth. His other
MSS. were one of St. Gallen nearly complete, and another ot
Ziirich containing the Odes, Epodes, and Ars Poetica, both ot
which he says are of the tenth· century. Other MSS. referred to
in these notes are the Vatican and other Roman MSS. collated by
Fen (1811); twenty-three MSS. in tha Royal Library at Paris
collated by Pottier (1823), varying in age from the tenth to the
thirteenth century; and sundry others quoted with or without
name by Lambinus (11771, Cruquius (law), Torrentius (1608 ⁸),
and Bentley (1711). 01 the last the most important are four
colhted by Cruquius, and known as the Blandinian MSS. belonging
to the mcnlrs of a Benedictine monastery in Plaudere, and which
were very soon aiterwffls destroyed with the monastery by fire.
The oldest of these, which is appealed to as a great authority, but
which was certainly more often wrong than right in the instantes
in which Cruquius quotes it, was said to he earlier than the ninth
century. On the margin of this MS. Cruquius found some old

notes, which, as he says, with infinite puina he deciphbred, and he
has added them to his own commentary in a separate form. 'lhese

scholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of Comm. Cruq.
They are chiefly made up of the commentaries of Acron and Por-

phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authori-
ties. 'l'he readings 01 these three Scholiasta help out the MSS,
