INTRODUOTION.

Tua materiale for Horace's life are derived almost entirely from hia
own works. A few additional facts are got from a short mcmoir
attributed to Suetonius.

He was born on the 8th December, auc. 689 (ac. 65), at cr near
Venusia¹ (Venosa), in the Apenninus, on the borders of Lucania aud
Apulia His father was a frsedmau², having, aa hia name proves, been
the slave of some person of the Horatla gens. Aa Horace implica that
he himself was ingenuus⁸, his father must have obtained his frecdom
before his birth. He ethelwerdo followed the calling of a eoactor⁴‚ a
collector of money in some way or other, it is not known in what. Hc
made in thia capacity enough to purchase an estate, probably a small
cue, near Venusia. We hear nothing of his mother, except that Horace
speaks of both hia parents with affection ⁵. His father, probably eeeiug
signs of talent iu him as a child, was not content to have him educated
at a provincial school, but took him (at what age he does not say, but
probably about twelve) ιο Rome, where he became a pupil of Orbibus
Pupillus⁸, who had a school of much note, attended by boys of good
family, and whom Horace remembered all his life aa an irritable teacher,
giren unneceesarily ιο the use of the rod. With him he learnt grammar,
the earlier Latin authore, and Homer. He attended other masters (of
rhetoric, poetry, and music, perhaps) as Roman boys were wont, aud
bad the advantage (ιο which he afterwards looked back with gratitude)
of hia father's carc and moral training during this part of hia educatiou.
lt was usual for young men of birth and ability to be sent ιο Athens to
finish their education by the study of Greek literature and philosophy
under native tcachcrs3 aud Horace went there ιοο, at what age ia not
known but probably when he was about twenty. Whether hie father
aas alise at that time or dead is uncmtaiu If he went ιο Atheus at
