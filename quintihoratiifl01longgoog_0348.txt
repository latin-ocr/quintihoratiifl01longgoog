ARGUMEN'P.

Bsmember that night when the moon was iu the sky, aud thou didst swem hdelity ιο
ms, saying that so long as the sheep lamed the wolf, and storms suad the wintu'r
ses, aud Apollo's locks floated in the breona, our mutual love should last. 'lhouslmh
rue my thmueos, Neaera. Flaccus will bear no rival. Let thy laithlmaan drirr
him to wrath and he will seek a truc henrt elsewhere. Let him onos lcarn to ham
thy beauty and he will be its captive no more, when grief shall hare settled in his
soul- And thou, whosoercr thou art, that boastast thysellin my sorrow, hs thou rich
in flocks and field«, and let Pactolus run gold l'or thess he thou mse in the secreta
of Pythagoraa and of lorm more beautiful thau Nireus; yet shalt thou werp for her
lore transferred to another, and my tum to lnuglr shall come.
