Unde simul primam me dimisere Philippi,
Decisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni

Et laris et findi, paupertas impulit audax

Ut versus facerem: sed quod non desit habentem
Quae poterunt unquam satis expurgare cicutae,
Ni melius dormire putem quam seribere versus?

Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes3

Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludum;

Tendunt extorquere poemata ς quid faciam vis?

Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque:

Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis,

Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro. to
