Wm Augustus had eompleted the period of ten years lor which the imperial power
w at drst placed in bis hands (au-c. itt-737), he determined ιο celebrate his sue·
ma at boum and abroad by an extramdinary festival, aud he took as hia moalcl the
Ludi Tarentini or Taurii, which had in former times been ohserved ae a means of pro-

the Sdrylline books, and tbey reported, uo doubt as they were desired, tbat the time was
coms when this great national festival should be repeated, eud the details ol it were
laid down in s set cf hexameter Greek verses, which have bcen preserved by the histo·
rian Ζοιὶιοοο, vrbo gives a description cf the festival (ii. 5). [Zosimus names the verses
