The same remark applica in some measure to other Odes mdicsseo
nominally to friends, but which might as easily be addressed ιο one
friend as to another. The differencc is that the names are in most
insunces known to be those of real persons, which has led many com·
mentators into inferences respecting the characters and circumstances
oi those persons which I believe to be in most instanres imaginary.

Ihare expressed my opinion of Horace as a Satirical writer in various
places. On this point the reader may refer ιο the remarks in the
Introduction ιο the ninth Satire of the first book. Of common sense
aud a perception of the ridiculous 3 of that knowledge of mankind which
is guthered by mixing with tha world3 of dramatic skill; ef good
natiue and good brecding, ‘Horace has shown sufficient proofs, both in
the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic hc is certainly defective.
llomer he does not appear ιο have understood. Plautus and Terence
he could not appreciata, and the merits of Lucilius (and he must have
had merite) would probably never have been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the feeling his criticism of that writer raised against
himself. He was of an indolcnt habit, of which the aufinished state of
some ol' his poema is one of the effecta. “Amphora coepit Institui3
canente ruta eur urceus exit ?” is a question that might be applied, I
think, to more than one cl his Satires and Epistles. There is more
inequality in these than in the Odes; more also that is common-place in
thought and diction. The Odes will bear better than the Satires and
Episties the close inspection that an editor is obliged to give them. Any
one who undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his priu-
cipsl difficulties consiste in the examinatior, first separately, and then
coleetively, os so many small picturas as the Odes present. The tendency
ol commentatore to far-fetched conjectures as to their scope, allusione,
«law, irc, is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts for it.
Their beanties and merite appear to me to be of a quiet kind, and
the happy selection cf words is ons oi them. Horace’s selection os
epitheta is judicious and forcible. ‘⁴ Mirus ac paene divinus Horatius
cst in epithetis inveniendis ⁶.'’ The terseness and good sense of the
sayings which concern human lise and character are as striking as
the manner in which they are introduced, being always in their place
aud never brought in clumsily, as such sentences with less art might
easily appear. Herein, more than in any other respect, Horace suc·
ceeded in his attempt to imitate the Greek Lyric poets. Their fire,
passion, sublimity, his language was incapable cf expressing, even ifhis
mind could have conceivcd them. Their matres have lost their strength
