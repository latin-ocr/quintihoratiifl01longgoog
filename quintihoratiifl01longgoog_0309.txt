iim cumr chsvisuns hed dctermined ou the expedition sgsinst M. Antonius und
Cleopstrs which led ιο the bsttle of Actium, sno. 72³, hs summoned, ss we lenm
horn Bion Osssius(50. 11), the leading smmtors und msu ol Equestrian rank tomect him
st Brundusium, fur the benerit of their counsel and (thu historiun ssys) ιο keep the
Fouestrisns from miscbicl, ond slso to show the world the hermony ιο which he had
brought men cf sll orders st Rome. whatever thc motivcs moy hsvc been, the fuet
nsybcsccepted. hlsccenss obcycd this summons und went ιο Brundusium, but wus
sent buck by Cscssr to vvutch over ths pmce oi the city und the affairs of Italy, with
shst psrticulsr ponem, cr under what title, history does not inform ns, nor is the
question material here. 'l'he Scholiasts (Acron und Comm. Cruq.) utute thst Maecenas
hsd received thc command of the lleet, cr pust of it ss tribune, from Augustus. But
these is no credit due ιο such stutemeuts, which ure osten tuhen (ns this mny be), like
the inscriptions invented by grummerisus, from incidcutsl numos sud sllusions in the
odssthemsslves. Hc sppesrs to hsvc scoompnnied the expedition ιο Sicily against
Sextus Pompeius suc. 718, sud thc writer cf the article ‘Mseoenus' in Smith’s
ilict Bicg. thinlrs thst this Epodc nus written on thnt occasion. 'l'his opinion is quite
rev, sud l believe the genmnl opinion ιο be correct. The hrngusgc os affection in this
Epcds is too strong for the short scquuintonoe Horace hod then enjoyed nith Messenen
slus, tuero is eddcnce οι the Subinc ferm huving come into Horucc's possession whsu
bo victe it (1.81). But thut this did not occur sill ustor the publication of the first
book oi Satires is certain, und it is generslly referred ιο suu. luo. The opinion cf
tbc ssnsc svritcr thot Horucc uctunlly scccmpenied Maecenas on this expedition tc
Sicily is noticcd elsewhere (C. iii. 4 28 n). Ιι is very possible that Maecenas msy
hsss hsd the oller of s commend in the expedition sgsinst M. Antonius, sud thet both
he sud Horace believed be wss going ou thet service, until ou his arrival ut Brundusium
Augustus thought utto send him buck ιο discharge moro importent duties et Rome.

lloescc, snppcsing him to be going cn this expedition, wished ιο uccornpuuy him, but
ilsscmss would not sllov it (v. 7), which guvc occasion for this Epods.
