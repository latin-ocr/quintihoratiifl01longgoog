INTRODUCTION. xxxi

C. i. 6.-This matre consiste of three Asclepiadean verses, euch ae

C. l,and a Glyeonean‚ae in C. 3. 1110. i. 15. stanneo a trocheo
ciectus in 'the first foot (see noto). The other Odee are i 24, 333 ii.12;
iii.10,16; iv.5, 12.

Ο. i. 7.—This measure takes its name from Alcman, the lyrio poet
of Sparta. It consiste of two verses, of which the first is a complete
hexameter, and the second is made up of the four last feet of an
hexameter. To thie belong C. i. 28, and Epod. xii.

C. i. 8.—The1e ie no other Ode iu this metre, which aleo consiste of
two verses. The first consiste of a dactyl and two trocheee, or a trochee
and spondae, ,„ υ υ1,, υ Ι ,, 3. This takes its name from Aristo·
phanea. The second ie a verse-of which the first half consiste of two
trocheee aud a dactyl, with along syllable added, aud the second half
is the first reversed, thus:

-Vi-’v‘i‘VUi-ii-VVi-Vi-:ae'

llorace always hae a spondes in the second place.

C. i. 9.—Thie is the ordinary Aleaie metra, in which each staura
consiste of four verses. The first two are divided thus:

:ii-vi-ui-uui-u:

though Horace usually substitutes a epondce for the second trocheo,
the only exception being iii. 5. 17. The caesura usually falle after the
fifth syllable, to which rule exceptione will be found in C. i. 16. 21, 37;
5, 14; ii. 17. 21 ; iv. 14. 17. This caesura the Greeks did not obse1ve.,
'ibe first syllable of the verse is more commonly long than short. It
is ustual to look upon the first part of the verae as iambic, and to divide
it thuee

z-iu-i-i·

eutr have no doubt it ia trochaic. The third verse is also trochaic,
consisting of a syllable (usually long) followed by four trochees‚ a
spondeo being substituted by Horace for the second trochee. The
fourth verse oonsists of two dactyle and two trochees.

C. i. ll.—Thie ie an Asclepiadean metro, rather peculiar. The
division to which we are guided by the ear seems to separate each
verse into three parts, ae follows:

--Ι-υυΙ-Η-υυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υυ
This classes it with the ἀσυνάρτητα. Those who reeort to the division

by choriambi destroy the natural rhythm. To this belong i. 183
tr. 10,
