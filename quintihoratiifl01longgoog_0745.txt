ARS POETICA. 705

Vicinus urbes alit et greve sentit aratrum,

Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus amnis

Doctus iter melius, mortalia fecte peribunt,

Quae nune suut in honore vocabule, si volet usus, '

Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norme loquendi.

Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristis bella

Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus.
