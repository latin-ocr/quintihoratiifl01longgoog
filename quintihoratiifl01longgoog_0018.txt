been oareful as far as possible tolet Horaoe illustrate himself,
without however distraoting the reader by referring him beok-
wards and forwerda to passages that will throw no light upon the
text.

The MSS. generally and most of the editions have inscriptions
or headings to the different poema. That these were not given
them by Horace himself is oleat, bnt they appear in the earliest
MSS„ and are supposed by some to have been invented by the
grammarians almost contemporary with the author. They vary
very muoh in the different MSS„ and as they are quite arbitrary

expressed or referred to in the text, the want of the other Index
will not be muoh felt.

Ι hed hoped it would ho possible to give engravings of a few
