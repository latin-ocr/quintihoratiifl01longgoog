xxxii INTRODUCTION.

O. ii. 18.-This Ode stands alone. Themetra has its name from
Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consists of threeutrocheea

followedby a single syllable, long or shortz

-ol-ol-ol:

The second of five trochaeo preceded by such a syllablez

zl-ol-:l-ol-ol-v
O. iii. la-This Ode ie also unlilse any other. Itis usual te divide
it into feet called Ionio Minor ( υ u , ,), of which the two first verses
coutain four each, aud the third contains two. Respecting this metra,
see Bentley's note. It would seem that Horace, imitating the subject l
of an Ode of Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metre also. The
Greek, as usual, has a much finer effect than the imitation.

O. iv. 7.-This metra takes its name from Archilochus, and eon·
siste cf an hexameter verse, followed by a verse which is the latter half
of a pentameter. There are no other Odes in this measure. .

Epod. i.—x.—The first ten Epodes are in the same matre, consisting
of alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondees ’
only in the uneven places. An anapaest is once introduced inii. 35.

Epod. :rt-This is one of the variatione of the iambic introduced
by Archilochus. The first verse is a trimeter iambic. The second is ,
ἀσυνάρτητος, ¹consisting of the last half of a pentameter followed bya ¹
dimeter iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of ὲ
vv. 6, 10, 26, and the hiatus in vv. 14, 24. Bentley has a note on this
metre which may be consultcd. l

Epod. xiii—This metre consists ef an hexameter verse, with one
made up, as Epod. xi, of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, the
difference being that these parts are here reversed.

Epod. xiv, rra—These are composed of an hexameter followed by a
dimeter iambic.

Epod. xvi-This consists cf an hexameter verse, followed by a pure
iambic verse.

Epod. xvii-This consists entirely cf trimeter iambic verses, being
the only Ode that does so.

The rule laid down by Meiueke, and adopted by many editors, which
affirma that the Odes which consist of single lines, or lines in alternate

measure, are to be divided into stanaas of four'verses, appears to me
too doubtful to be adopted.
