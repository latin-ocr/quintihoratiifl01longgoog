CARMHN XV.

This is probably sn early composition of Hor-sce, mede up ol materiale from the Greek,
und written merely to exorciso his pen. The Scholiasta found s political allusion in the
ode: Paris being H. Antonius, and Helen Cleopatra 3 aud Baxter, d διλογίστης, hasseired
upon the notion, which others also have adopted. .¹l'hs judieious reader will see that
there is no probability of such being the drift ol the ode. Nereus is made to speal be-
cause the sea-gods were endowed with the gut of prophecy. Porphyrion on this ode says
it is en imitation of Bacchylides, who makes Cassandra foretell the destruction of l'roy
as Horace does Nereus. There is a fragment (29 Bergk) which is supposed ιο belong
to the poem referred tu by this Scholiast, but it bears no resemblance to Horace's ode.

Aias! for the sweatiug ol horse and rider‚ and the desths thou art bringing upon
