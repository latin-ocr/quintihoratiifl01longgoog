Ihave done my best 10 determine the merita 01 the various
readings, and to ehoose in every disputed case the best, according
10 my judgment. I have given in a note the amount 01 authority
101 each disputed reading that I bave adopted, and there is 001 0
word in the text which has not good MS. authority. “Lectiones
ex conjectura profectas tanquam pestem a contextu procul me
removisse dico¹.’' 101100 who are accustomed to look upon
Bentley as abenefactor to the text 01 Ηο1000, this statement will

numerous conjectural readings 01 Bentley (nearlyall 01 which I
have referred to in the notes) 00 00 many instances 01 false tacte
and perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, “conjecturae summi Critici, etsi semper sagaces
