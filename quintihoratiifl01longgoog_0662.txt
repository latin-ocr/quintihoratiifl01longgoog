622 HORA'PII FLACOI

Quidquid eret nactus praedae majoris ubi omne
Verterat in fumum et cinerem, Non hercule miror,
Aiebat, si qui comedunt bona, cnm sit obeso

’ Nil melius turdo, nil vulva pulchrius ampla.
Nimirum hic ego sum; nam tute et parvula laudo
Cum res deficiunt, satis inter vilis fortis;
Verum ubi quid melius contingit et unctius idem
Vos sapere et solos aio hene vivere, quorum

Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis.
