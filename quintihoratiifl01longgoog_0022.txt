xiv PREFACE.

allusione in modern writings become after a few years. Horace did
a good deal to improve the Latin language, and he took the liberty,
which he defends, of saying many things in a new way. His
poetica] power was grau and varied 3 aud if he had possessed more
energy of character, he might have done even more than he has.
But what he has left is a procl ol his talent. He gave the Romane,
as far as their languagc would permit, a set of lyrical compositione
both in matter and form not unworthy copies or imitatione cf thc
Greek 3 and though such imitation is a confession of inferiority and
sometimes is feeble and trifling, he still shows that he could infuso
the vigour of the Latin tongue into the measures of Sappho and
Alcaeus, and present to us a variety of natural and plessing
images in language simpla, concise, and expressive. A last careful
reading ol Horace's lyric poems, alter a long acquaintance with
them, has made me estimate them higher than I did, and even
when heis less successful, I feel more indulgence towards the poet

Introduction 3 and a recent writer in “ Blackwcod's Magazine”
(No. DCXXX.), “On the Causas of Horace's Ropularityl’ has

But how do we know that we have what Horace wrote? A work

which has come down to us from a very remote time by successive
transcriptione must contain many errors. Even books when they
have been often reprinted differ very much from the original. The
general consent of the manuscripts of Horace isthc only evidence
of what he wrote 3 aud it isa wonder that the diversities in the
text are not more than they are. But these diversities are sufficient
to prove that in many passages we cannot discover the true read.

documentary evidence of the manuscripts, and to attempt to derive
from the various readings some probable conclusion. This branch
of the critical art requires great labour, judgment, and teste, and we
are much indebted to scholare for what they have done towards
