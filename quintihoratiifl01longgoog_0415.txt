SATIRE V.

In the year 1110. 714, after 111 talring of Perusia by Caesar Octavianus, 1111101111

01111 journey recorded in this Setire is certain, beceuse Horace was 101 introduced to
llaecenas tlll the beginning of 110. 716. 111 same objection, among several others,
is 11111 1011111101] which connects the journey with the spring of the year 716. At
thet time 1111101101 arrived at Brundusium with his fleet at the requeat of Caesar,
who 111 selred him for help against Sex. Pompeius ς 111 101 finding Caesar there, he
111] 1001 took his departure. This ie the data adopted, among many others, 1] Hein-
1011. 11 has been diaposed of by Kirchner (Quaeret. Hor. 656 sqq.) in a way that can-
notbe answered. In the spring 01 111 following year 717, Antonius brought over an
army 10 Italy, and a fleet 01 30011111 (Appiam v. 93 5 Dion Cass. 48. 545 Plnt. Ant.
c. 35): ἔκ τινων διαβολῶν παροξυνθεὶς πρὸς Καίσαρα, says Plutarch. He pretendetl,
Dion says, 10 come for the purpose 01 helping 10 put down Sex. Pompeius, but his real
object was rather 10 101 what was going on than 10 take any active part. He 0111110
Brundusium, but tha peopla would not let him into the 1111011 (according 10 Ρ11-
nnn), and 11 therefore went on 10 Tarentum. Negotiations were carried 01 between
the two 111111 (Caesar being at Rome) through agenta employed by both, but without
effect, till Octavia undertook 10 mediate between her husband and brother, and was
finally 1100111111 11 reconciling them. It has been supposed, with every probability,
1111 111 11111101 which Horace accompanied was sent by Caesar 10 meet 1110111101 hia
expected arrival at Brundusium 01 1111 occasion, in the spring 011110. 717. Thattbe
11101 was 101 winter may be inferred froin v. 14, where Horace speaks 01 being dis·
tnrbed 1] the gnate and fruge. 'l'hat it was not summer is probsble from the party
reqrriring 1 lire 11 Trivicnm (r. 80). Appisn etates expresaly that Antonius arrived
et Brundusium ἦρος ἀρχομένου, which corresponds with the above facts.

llorace started from Rome with only one companium Heliodorus the rhetorician
(1.2),111 they travelled together three 11]1111 one night, duty-one Romen miles, till
they reached Terracina or Anxur, where by appointment they were to meet the 0110111
membera 01 their party. 'l'heee were Maecenas and Cocceius, who had been employed
in negotisting the first reconciliation between Caesar and Antonius, end Fonteius,
11 intimate friend 01 Antonius. Three days afterwards 111] met at Sinuessa Horace’s
three 11011 intimate friends, Plotina 111001, Varius, 111 Virgil; one ofwhom, Verius,
kept them company only for six days, aud left them, for ressone which are not men·
rioned, 11 Canusium (v. 93). ’111 reat 01 111 party went on together till they reached
Brundusium, fifteen days aster Horace had left Roma The route they took was 101
111 11011111 orthe caelest, which lay through Venusia and 1111111111. They preferred
taking the 1011 which atrikes across the country from Beneventum, and, reaching tha
coast 11 Barium, continues along the 11010 till it eomas to Brundusium. They were
evidently not preseed for time, and probably toolr the road they did 1111111 11 passed
through (1111111111111111101101 the party was bound. Maecenas made his journey
uagreesble 11 under the circumstances it could be, by taking with him such oom-
punionn 111 111] all appear 10 grant advantage in Horace's good-humoured diary.
lbere rrae no restraint between the patron and 111 friends. 111 their affection for him
