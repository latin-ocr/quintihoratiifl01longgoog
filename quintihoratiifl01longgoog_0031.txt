INTRODUCTION. xxiii

more genuine in Horace’s writings than his expressions of affection for
his bether and for Maecenas. His gratitudo to Maecenas never takes
the form ef servility, his affection never savonrs of affectatiou, and his
lumiliarity never approaches to impertineuce. He sees in Maecenas'
gista to himself only the genereus disposition of the giver, of which he
has no thought of taking undue advantage; his patronage he neither
exaggeratas nor uudcrvalues; ior his health he feels tenderly; his
danger he tries to share3 and his anxieties he dces his best to scothe.
Itis evident that Maecenas valued his society aud understood his
character.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
many persons of consideration whose friendship he appears to have
enjoyed. Through Maecenas also itis probable Horace was introduced
tc Augustus, but when that happened is uncertain. In acac. 717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonius at Brundi·
sium¹ and he took Horace with him on that journey, of which an amusing
aeacum is given in the fich Satira of the first book. Horace appears
to have parted from the rest οἰ the company at Brundisium, and per·
hapa returned to Rome by Tarentum and Venusia (See S. i. 5, lut).
Between this jonrney and acc. 722 Horace received from his hiend
the present of a small estate in the valley of the Digentia (Licenza),
situated about thirty-four miles from Rome, and fourteen from Tibur, in
tbeSabine country. of this property he gives adescription in his Epistle
to Quintius (i. 16), and he appears to have lived there a part of every year,
aud tc have been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), the eentre of the
district, but of no grem importauce. During this interval he con· ⁴
tinued to write Satires and Epodes, but also, it appears to me probable,
some of the Odes, which some years laterbe pubiishedand others which
he did not publish. These compositione Ihave no doubt were seen by
histriends, and were pretty well known before any of them were collected
lor publication. It will appear from the separate Introductions to the
aversi Satires ol the first book that there is not one which might not
have been written by the year auc. 719, and in that year Frauhe
cupposes the first book was published. It may have been so, but
Franke’s arguments are not conclusive. In auc. 723 the battle of
Aetium was fought, and in the prospectos Maecenas having a command
cn that occasion, Horace wrote him a tonching poem, which stands first

iuthe book of Epodes. The ninth Epode was written immediately
abnuo victory, and there is no poem in the book cf Epodes which
need be placed later. Iagree therefore with Franhe in thinking that
book, cf which one or two poems are among Horacc’s earliest composi-
tione, may have been published iu aum. 724. In that year was written,
