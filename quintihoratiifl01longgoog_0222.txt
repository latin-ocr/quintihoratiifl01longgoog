182 HORA'I'II FLACCI

Late conspicuum tollere verticem,
Maecenas, equitum decus.
Quanto quisque sihi plura negaverit,
Ab dis plura feret: nil cupientium
Nudus castra poto et transfuga divitum
Partes linquere gestio,
contemptae dominus splendidior re'i, as
Quam si quidquid arat impiger Apulus
Occultare meis dicerer horreis,
Magnas inter opes inops.
Purae rivus aquae silvaque jugerum
Paucorum et segetis certa fides meae ³0
Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae
Fallit sorte beatior.
