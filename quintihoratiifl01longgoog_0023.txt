PREFACE. xv

matter. Ido not feel that Ι bave any peculiar aptitude for this
, kind of work, aud the same may be said of many who have under-
tulreu it. I have, however, noticed nearly all the variatione in
liitter’s text, and I think that some of them are improvements. I
have uotimd also some of Keller's readings in the Odes, but I have
found very little in them that seems to me of any value.

When the manuscripts agree, and there is nothing unintelli-
gible, it is consistent with the evidence to leta passage stand as it
is, aud it is inconsistent to attempt to improve it. When there is
diversity of readings in any case, we must determine which we will
amept on abalanoe of probabilities. If no reading gives a sufficient
ense, we may endeavour to extract from the supposed false readings
something which does give a sense and may be what the copiers
would have written if they had taken due care. Many excellent
mnections have been made in this way, aud they commend them·
selues to our judgment as true, that is, as possessing sufficient
probability to be accepted as true.

'lbere is another method which we may use in deoiding between
condicting readings, and also in determiniug whether a passage,
where there is no variation in the readings, may be considered
guuine. In the case of Horace, for example, ifwe study the
gerard purpose of each poem, if we have made ourselves well ao-
quainted with his manner of expression and his poetic colouring,
and ifwe fix our attention closely on all the words of a given pas-
sage, aud the connexion of the whole passage with that which
precedes and follows, we may often determine with great probability
what he intended to write, where the evidence leaves it doubtful;
md we may also determine whether critice are justified in patting
their own goesses in place of the documentary evidence, when there
iano vanation in it. 'l'he power of justly interpreting is therefore
³ necessary qualification fora critic who undertakes to settle a text
whether ancient or modern 3 as necessary as it is for the commen·
tator who undertakes to explain his author. There are indeed in
Horace many passages, where the text may be quite right, and yet
the interpretation is doubtful. I have found more of these passages
tbauI expected, and some about which editors will always differ.
