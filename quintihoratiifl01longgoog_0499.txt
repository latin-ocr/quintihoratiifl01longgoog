'liris Seth-e appears ιο haro been written during the Saturnalia in the montb of De·
sember, hmo. 722. In the year before, Agrippa had been hedilo, and bis Aedileship is
alluded ιο in v. 185. lt was written at Horaoe’s country house, not long, it may be
supposed, after it was given him. He was improving the home st the time, as we may
infer from v. 308. 'l'he Satine is general, taking in the leading vices and follius cf
liuman natura—ambition, amrice, extravagance, lust, superstition, which are brought
ιομιιιοι· with some ingenuity.

One Damasippus, a man who had wasted a good fortune in speculating as an amateur
in all sorts of costly articles, particularly works of art, in which be was held ιο bea
connaissaur, is introduced in ι new character as a Stoic philosopher, repmving Horace
for his haim, and urging him to write. He relatas the story of bis own conversios
ιο philosophy, which was thiar When he had lost all his fortune, and got hopelessly
involved with money-leaders, and found himself langhed at and called madman where·
eser he went, he grew desperate, and was going to throw himself into the liber,
alian hc was arrested by Stertinius, aa oracle of the Stoice, who remonstrated with
him and consoled him, and at lha same time anned him against bis euemies (v. 297)
with along homily, in the course of which he proved that all the world but tbe good
uod wisc were as mad as be was. In this discourse he enumeratas the chief features of
this unium-saal madness, and this forms tho bnlk of the Satira.

'l'o Darrmsippus s Scholiast gives the gentile name J nnius. [There was a Praetor L.
lunius Brutus Damasippus, who was killed no. 82 in the light before the walls of
noma] Ernesti, in his clavis toCioero, says that itwas aoognomenof the Liciniageus,
and Orelli calls him Licinius Damasippus, but Cicero, who mentions him three times,
narinus him only Damasippus. Cicero, wishing to purcbasa a piace of ground on which
ιο crecta shrirm ιο the memory of Tullia, heard that Damasippus bad some ιο dispose
of on thebanis of the liber, aud commissioned Atticus ιο negotiata with him for it
(sd litt. xii. 29. 33). On another ceramon he commissioned ι friend (rebius Gallus) ιο
buy him some statues topnt in bis library. He bought some which Cicero did not like,
md thought ιοο oostly. lt appears that Damasippus had bid for them too, and wanted
to have them l for Cicero writes, “Velim maneat Damasippus in sententia—si enim
nou manabit, aliquem pseudodamasippam rel eum jactura reperiemus '³ (sd Pam. rii.
