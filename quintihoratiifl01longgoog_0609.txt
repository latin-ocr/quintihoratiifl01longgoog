HPISTLH IV.

Something 1111 been said about Albius Tibullus, thc poet, in 1111 Introduction to C. i.
33, which iseddreseed tobim, as this 11111111 11. Horace writesto him (probably from
Rome) st his place near Pedum, 1 town of latium, not fur from Praeneste, which, Por·
phyrion says, did not exist in his day, and the site oi which is supposed to be occupied
by the modern town fagarola 1111111111 had 1 good 111111 thero, inhcrited from his
father, which before his death he appears by some means to have diminished (S. 1. 4.
28 n.). That it wris not by his own extravagsnce, aud that his losses must 1111111-
curred ester this Epistle was written, we may perhaps infer from v. 7. Η1 alludes to
1111111 in the first of his elegius (1. 1. 19 sqq.)=

‘¹ Vos quoquc, felicis quondam nunc pauperis agri
Custodes, fertis munera vestra lares ;'’

aud in Lib. iv. 1. 181 sqq. thereare some bitter liuesou the samo subject. But it isnot
probuble that these lines were written by Tibullusy and if not, the languageof 1111 elegy
above quoted is not enough to prove that the diminution of the property took placa
ulter it came into 1111 possession. He might eall his 111111 ‘pauperem agrum’ by 11111·
parison, and hc might still hy Horacs's standard be rich. He says ini. 1. 41:

‘¹ Nou ego divitias patrum, fructusque requiro
Quos tulit antiquo condita messis avo.’'

Hc may therefore be supposed to contrasthis estate with what it was in the times before
he came to it, rather than with its earlier condition under himself. Naverthelcas there
are some who suppose that Horace wrote this Epistle to console 1111111111, and to chide
him for being melancholy, referring to v. 12, which, as Orelli says, 1111111111 nothing
more than a general description of humun life. The description Horace gives of
Tibullua' person is confirmed by an old biography, which 11111 him ‘⁴ 1111111 Rommm
insignis forma cultuque corporis observabilis.'' He lived chiefly on his 111111 in the quiet
pursuits Horace here supposes him to he engaged in; but in 11117211111111111111
ouer the battle of Actium, he accompunied Messalla into Gaul and was absent about a
year, which as far as we know comprised ull hia active life, though Disseu 1111 endea-
voured to show that for ten years, from auu. 712 to 72111 served in the army.
Horace among other blessings assigna him good 11111111 ; neverthcless he died young. It
11111111 that while many disparuged Horace’s writiugs Tibullus judged them hiudly,
and the affection tho two poete bore oue another cannot be mistalren. 1111111111 was
probably 1111 or twelve years younger than Horace. Various attempta haue been made
to gire a dete to the Epistle, but noue are satisfactory to my mind. 'libutius died thc
