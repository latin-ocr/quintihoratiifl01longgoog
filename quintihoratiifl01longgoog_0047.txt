CARMINUM 1. 2.

OARMEN ΙΙ.

⁴suc. 725.

This ode wss probably written ou the return of Cseser Octavianus [named Augustus,
ne. 27] to Rome, aller the taking of Alexandria, when the civil ware were ended, and
the temple of J auus was shut, hoo. 725. Horace exprsoess the opinion which 'lacitus
(hun. i. 9) atetoe was held by reflectiug meu of all parties, “non aliud discordantis
prtrise remedium fuisse quam ut ab uno regeretur,’' that the only remedy left for the
troubles of the state was an absolute goverument iu the hands of oue person. He bas
been chsrged with deserting his republican principles, anderen urgiug the destruction
of those whose party be had once belonged to, audwitb whom be had fought at Philippi.
lint lidrace urges reform, not bloodsbod3 aud he hed lived long enoughto seethat reform
wss not to be expected at the hands of republican leaders, or from any but him whoes
genitu was now iu the asceudant. lt is uot therefore in any mean spirit that he urges
Octsriauus to take upou himself the task of rodocing to order tho clements oi the
state, which so many years of civil war bad throwu into confusion—Nono of Hornce's
odes arc moro jnstly celebrated than this for the imagery it contains, forits genuine
reding, and for the delicacy with which it flatters Octavianus, iuvesting him with divino
sttributea but inriting him to exorciso them as a father correctiog aud defendiug his
children, sud thus to drenge in tbs noblest manner his great-oncle’s murder. 'l'he
sapiu which he introduces the name of caess unexpectedly etthe eud has always
appeared to me an instance of consummate art.

'l'hc prodigies described at the beginning of this ode srethoss which weresdd tohars
followed the doeth of O. J ulius Cacsar. They ers related also byVirgil, Gergeseo-
489, which passage, und the verace that follow it to the eud of tbe book, shouldberead iu
connexion with this ode. lt will sppeer to any rcader of both rerpprobable thet Horace
had this description iu his mind whcu hs wrote. lt has been thought thet Horace could
not bare referred to prodigies which hed occurred so long before (ae-o. 710, listeeu years
before this ode was written), when he wes at Atheus, aud therefore could not bare
witnessed them. Other prodigies therefore bave boen mmcd astho subject of these
openhg chaum. But tbe only other occasions, about thia time, wheu the'liberis
recorded to have overdowed its banus, wcue eoo 727 and 782, the earliest of which
,reare would be too lete for this ode, in which the allusione to tho state of Rome sud
the triumphs cf Augustos (r. 49), and the proposal thet he should semme apreme
authority, would iu thet case hers besu out of dete and umeoessary. Ono of the
chief purposes professed by Augustus wss tbo avsuging of his adoptive father'e death3
see Suet. Octav. x.: “Nihil convenientiae ducens quam necem avunculi vindicare
tuerique acta.” Tacitus slso speaks othim (Anu. i. 9) as “pietate erga perehtm-
sd arms civilis ectum? which his enemies turned against him, saping, “Cassii et
Brutorum exitus pslemis inimicitiis datos, quanquam fassit privata odia in publicis
utilitatibus remittere.” According to Diou Cassios (liii. 4) his declared purpose was
duur τᾷ rs turpi rever σφαγέντι τιμωρῆσαι nol τὴν πόλιν ἐκ μηδλην καὶ ἐπαλλήλων

:affigentem Ovid (fast. v. 5⁷8, sqq.) introduces him as uttering this prayer
to ι

“ Si mihi bellandi pater cst Vestssqne secordes
Auctor, st ulcisci numen utrumque paro 3
Mus, ades et satis scelerato sanguiue ferrum,
Stetque feror cause pro meliore tuus.
Temple feres et me victore vocaberis ultor.''
