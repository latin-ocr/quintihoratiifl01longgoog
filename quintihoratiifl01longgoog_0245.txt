lhe length οι· thia ode is more imposing than the subject, which appears to he a jour·
ney ιο Grcece (v. 19) proposed ιο be taken by a lady of Horace's acquaintance, whom
hc pretends ιο deter from her purpose, by reciting the dangers she will have ιο encountcr
and the fate that weita upon female obstinacy, as illustrated hythe story of Europa,
which story occupies two-thirsis of the ode, and thrasts Galatea and her journey from
the scene altogether. Ido not see the difficulty cf the ode that has arrested most of
the editors. 'lhe length oi the digression is simply a way with Horace (as in the story
oi Regulus, C. iii. 5, and of Hypermnestra, iii. 11), and Iindm toolr the same liberty
with greater heodem. It is a peculiarity which imitatore of Horace will do well to
note, sor if akilfully managed it would relieve the tameness of many an ode which, pro-
iessing ιο be sn imitation oi this author, has little but his rhythm and a fewof his
phrases to sustain the resemblance. [Ritter's remark on the lady is a good specimen
ol his manner os interpretation. 1r it does not instruct, it may amuse. ‘⁴ Galatea a
lacteis brachiis cervicequecandida nominata, olim Horatio cara jam virum divitem in
itinere comitari voluit. lter illud aut in Cretam insulam dirigebatur, aut a viros
familia Taurorum orto suscipiebatur. Alterum ut conjiciam faciunt verba (w. 25)=
‘sie et Europe niveum doloso credidit tauro latus' (nt tu Taurum sequi animum in-
duxisti).”]

By similar arguments Propertius (ir 8) debers Cynthia from going ιο sea, and Ovid
Corinna (Am. ii. 11). 'lhe Scholiast on Homer (ll. xii. 307) says the story of Europa
was treated by Bacchylides, whose poem has no⁰t come down to us, nor any part of it,
but was probably, as Orelli says, in Horace's hands. The Scholiast's account of the
story is Just that of the present ode. lt would bc difficult to find a more touching pic·
ture than Horace has drawn of a young girl suddenly torn from her childish amuse-
ments transportcd far stom the security οι her home, and lelh forlorn among strangam,
lnowing no tie bnt that of her fathers lose, to which she instinctively turns with long-
ing andrell'reproachr her fault bad been in giving way to a loolishimpulsc, but she sees
har crime through her seara, which magnify it greatly by pointing to the probable issue,
so that she loolrs upon her idle curiosity us nothing less thau mudnesa (v. 36). There
iselae great slrill in the last mansas, in which we have, lirst, the derisiwe laughter with
which'Venua and her son (whose bow is now unatrung because it has done its work, the
Scholiast says) break in upon the unhappy girl ς then the ironieal prophecy in which
ber own 'words are used against her; end, lastly, the serious consolation and congratu-
lation with which they announce her good fortune, and bid her riae to it. 'lhe pain
lesing from her complerint is thus relieved, aud wa are lest with the conviction that she
ismaeles ιο her destiny aud proud of it.

ARGUMENT.

Iaet the wiehed go on their way with evil omens. I dobut prayior thee that thestorm
my be averted. Be happy go where thou wilt, and remember me, Galatea. Fear not
those idle omaus: bnt see the rising storm: 1 know the dangers it portenda May
they tall upon my enemy rather than on thee. lt was thus Europa left her girlish
aaa aad crossed the sea by night, but feared not till she stood on the shore of Crete.
Thea slse cried ont in anguish, “Alasl my father, a daughter’s name I have aban·

donau lose is swallcwed up in medaeas. What an exchange is here! Many deaths
doldcscrretodie. Am lawakc, arisit a meam? Was it better ιο crosa thesea
lban to guther young flowers at home? Othat I might arenga myself on that
nonar once too dearly loved. sarno on ma that I leit my home 3 shame thstI
dclay tedio. Iret mc go nabad among lions and perish by tigers, rather than waste
away in a lingcrlng desib. Vile girl, thy father taunts thee: why dost thou not dia?
