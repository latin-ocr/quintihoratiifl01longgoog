uitare Commentary, and I have got good matter from it. Ritter

sasharp critic and a learned man, who has done something for
the explanation of Horace, and I acknowledge my obligations to
him. It is his business to excuse himself, if he cau, for writing
some absurd notes and proposing some interpretatione which no
sensible man will accept.

Ι have also used for the Satires and Epistles Kriiger's school
edition, with German notes. Itis a very useful book. The notes
prove that the editor has good judgment, and what we in this
country call sound common sense, in which many learned editors
are very deficient.

lhave not touched Mr. Maoleaue's arguments and introductione, ⁸ i· ¹

except in very few cases; nor have Ι added any thing on the chro-
nology of the poema, except a little here and there. Mr. Macleane
has done this very well. He judicionsly abstained from fixing “
dates where there is no evidence, unlike many critios who have
sometimes fixed them without evidence and sometimes contrary to
eridence Indeed, most commentatore have very imperfect concep-
tions of the nature of proof3 and it would be a great improvement
if they could be taught in some way not to confound hypotheses
and guesses with probable conclusione and demonstration.

Ι shall here put a question which some people may think unne-
offlaary3 but Ι do not think so. When a manhas been usedto
read a book at intervals for half a century, he may reasonably ask
himself whether he has been wasting his time, and whether other
persons may not do the same. There are only few books worth
reading often or much ς but Horace is one of them. He lived with
some of the chief men of an age when the Roman polity was chang-
ing into a form which has had a lasting influence on Europe, and
through Europe on the rest of the world; and his writinga have
made us familiar with the man himself, with the times in which he
lived, the character of his contemporaries, and the manners of the
day. Horace's good sense makes his Satires and Epistles almost as
intelligible and as instructive as if they were written now; for the
best part of them is independent of the allusione to things and per·
sons, and many of the allusione are not more obscure than similar
