HORATII FLACCI

Multi Lydia nominis
Romana vigui clarior Ilia.
Me nunc Thressa chloe regit
Dulces docte modos et citharae sciens, lo

Si parcent puero fata superstiti.

Diduciosque jugo cogit aeneo,
Si flava excutitur chloe
Rejectaeque petet jenua Lydiae? 20
Quamquam sidere pulchrior
Ille est, tu levior cortice et improbo

Iracundior Hadria,
Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens.
