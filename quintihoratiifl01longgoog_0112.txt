HORA'I'II FLACCI

oARMuN XXXIII.

'l'he uiant elegiae properly attributed to 'libullna mention only two mistrmaa ol his.
under tho names of Delia and Nemesis, and these are the only two that Ovid mentions
in the beautiful elegy he wrote on that poet's death (Amor. iii. 9. 81, 55 sqq.). Orthe
person he calla Delia he was enamoured during the earlier part of his life3 of Nemea
during his later years. He died between thirty and forty, about the sometime asVirgil.
Much hae hoen written to prove that the Glycera of this ode stands for Delia (aaa par-
ticularly Spohn daA.'1ihnlli vita et carm. p. 50, 96, who believes that Delia, Nemesis,
Glycera, Neaera-a nameoeonrring only in the third book, which Tibullus, it is pretty

certaimdid not write, wercalltha samewoman). Others haveidentiticd Glyceran-itt Ι

Nemesis, on account of the number and quantity of the syllables being the nme, and

the epitheta 'Iihnllua applias to her, ‘avua' ‘rapax,’ ‘saera' ‘dura’ which correspond '

to Horace's ‘immitia’ Dissen ia certain that Glycera is neither Delia nor Nemesis, but
another mistress otherwise unknown Orelli leof the same opinion, but adda that those
who thus attempt to settle to anicety the loves oi Roman gentlemen, and pretend to
know mora about them than they have told us, only create a smila among those who
have lived long in Franco or Italy-implying that hia countrymen were had judges of
the amusementa of their more gallsut neighbours. It ia not even certain that (tibullus
wrote the pitit'ul elegiea Horace speaks of. Glycera is one of Horaoe’s nvoeriee mmet
and mnnot be taken ior a real name here or elsewhere. It occure in Plautus (llil
Glor. ii. 5. 26) and Martini (xiv. 187). Whather the person had any moro reality than
the name or the verses, is, Ithinh, doubtful 'I'hat Tibullus wrote elegias, that hewse
not rarely crosscd in love, and thet he was on some occasion in a desponding humour,
are facte sufficient to form a probable foundation t'or this good-tempered little poem.
Whoerer goes further than thia will nnn he ie out oi hia depth.

Horace was much attached to Tibullus, who wasa favoudte with his contemporaries. ,
Tohim was addressedthe fourth epistleofthehretbook. ¹

(loma, Albius, do not be drawllng pitiful poetry upon Glycera, beccum she prefers a
younger man to yon. Protty Lycoris lovea Cyrus, Cyrus inclines to Pholoe, who

bringing oppositas under the yolse together. Scit happened to nra-a tendor haart

cruel than the waree of tha Hadriatie.
