Nec, si quid fricti ciceris probat et nucis emptor,
Aequis accipiunt animis donantve corone.
Syllaba longe brevi subjecta vocatur iambus,
Pes citus3 unde etiam trimetris accrescere jussit
Nomen iambeis, cum senos redderet ictus
Primus ad extremum similis sibi. Non ite pridem,
Tardior ut paulo graviorque veniret, ad aures,
Spondeos stabiles in jura paterna recepit
Commodus et patiens, non ut de sede secunde
Cederet aut quarta socialiter. Hic et in Acci
Nobilibus trimetris apparet rarus, et Enni

In scenam missos cum magno pondere'versus
Aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis

Aut ignoratae premit artis crimine turpi.

Non quivis videt immodulata poemata judex,

Et date Romanis venie est indigna politis
Idcircone vager scribamque licenter? an omnes
