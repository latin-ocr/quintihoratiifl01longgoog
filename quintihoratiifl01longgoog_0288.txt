'Ibe commentatore are much divided in their opinions aa to tlie person ιο whom this l
ode is addressed. The old inscriptions vary, hut in such a manner as to show that nour l
oi them have any weight or authority. Torrentius mentione three MSS. which ars J
headed “Ad Virgilium Unguentarinm urbia discriptio (ιιο common blunder sor ‘dr-
acriptio') Paruenetice‚'' and ha himself adopts this absurdity, derived from' v. 17. 'ihs
Scholisst Acron says, “Ad Virgilium negociatorem scribit,” which isa mere assumption
from tho opening lines and v. 25, and when he interprete ‘⁶ juvenum nobilium” (r. 15)
as Augustus, or Maecenas, or the step-sons of Augustus, he shows be knew nothing ol
what he was writing about. lf the question were to ιο deeided by numbers, it would
on the whole be given in favour of Virgil ιιο poet, and the presumptiou is so rauel iu
favour of that notion that the proof of the contrary lica 1 think with those who deny
it. Gesner says there ia nothing in the ode ιο indicate so warm a friendship assub-
sisted between Horace and the poet Virgil. But the ode is οι best a tritis, aad an iu·
vitation ιο dinuer is not the most inspiring subject. When Virgil was going to aaa

may mean Augustus and Maecenas, they at least concede the point tbat ‘olisna’
may mean Virgil the poet Augustus ia represented as a ‘juvenis' in the aerood
ode ottho first boolr, v. 41 n. Tha difficulty that urisea out of v. 25, ‘pone-studium
lucri,' Orelli himself disposes of, in his note on that verse, when he says that it is
