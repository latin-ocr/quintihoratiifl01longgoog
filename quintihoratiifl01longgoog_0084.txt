HORA'I'II FLACCI

GARMEN XVII.

lt moy entertsin the reader to know that a treatise was once written on the mbjsct
of Horace's Tyndaris,·in which it was proved to the satisfaction of the writer thet she
was afreedwoman of Rhoemetalces, king oi'Thrsce3 that she is the person Horace else
where spmlrs of ss Thressa Chloe, simply Chloe, snd Venus Marino ς niso thet she sss
ιι possess. It being assumed thet the last ode was addressed ιο Tyndaris, according ιο
the common inscriptions, it is supposed by many thet the lovers hsd made up their

(lumel, and thet Horace here proposes a meeting to seul their reconciliation. All this

which is plainly nnreasonable should be put sside by any who wish ιο understand Horace,

There isne connexion between the two odes, except thet the title, which belongs iothis,

hasbeen horrowed for the other, aud there' rs no reasonto suppose that Horace, writing

at his farm, had any other than an imaginary Tyndaris, with uu imsginsry Cyrus, ιιι
