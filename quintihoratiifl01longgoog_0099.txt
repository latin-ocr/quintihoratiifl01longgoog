passage, as it contains with sufficient accuracy most of the events of Parthian history
which Horace alludes to. 'lhe assembliugof the Scythian force aud the alarin of Tiri-
datcsare evidently referred to here, aud the two seem to be associated It is natural
to infer. therefore, that it was just before Tiridates fied from his kingdom, in anu.
rsa, that the ode was compared Some, however, have referred it to the period when

Phraater' ambassadore were iu tveaty with Augustus, aud when the fate of Tiridates

wrsuudecided, which would put the date a year later. Others again hare assumed

that the whole of the transactione described by J ustiu are to be referred ιο the year
ua and that Tiridates never fied to Augustus in Spain at all. This is the Judgmeut
of lachmann (Let. to Franke‚ p. 239), but it ie rather an unwarrautable judgmeut.

Justinhad the history of lingue, which he abridged, end must have known better

thau Lachmann what it contained. Hi reason, moreover, for wishing to place the dete

of the cde further back is nothing more than au objectiou to the rhytbm of the 7th and
llth versa, which is a very fallacious argument. ln favour of the earlier date is
eumd, by Orelli, Virg. Georg. ii. 495 :-
“Illum nou populi fasces nou purpura regum ⁴
Flexit et infidos agitans discordia fratres ;''
where the brethren are Phraates and Tiridates. The Georgica having been written not
iaterthan‘r'24, it is assumed that the events above referred to must have taken place
before that year. But the earlier aud unsuocessful deeigue of Tiridates are more pro·
hahlyreferred ιο by Virgss. Aguinst the earlier date there is au argument of much
weight in the age of lamia. He died auo. 786 (Tac. Anu. vi. 27), and the year before
hebed heldtheoffiee of praefert of the city. If he was only twenty when this ode was
rnttsn he must have been eightytwo when ha died, aud eighty-one when he held the
shore prat, which was madeone of considerable importauce hy Augustus, eud continued
to he so under hie successor. He is described us being ‘vivida senectute' at the close
of his life, aud it is just possible he may have held the above post at that edvauced age,
bnt it is not probable, eud l think it a fair argument, ae far as it goes, for puttiug the

date of the ode aa late as we cau. For further particulare respectiug lamia sec iii. 17.
