SATIRE ¹VII.

'l'he substance οι· this Satira Horace puta into the mouth of his slave Darna giving
him liberty to express himself as he pleases on the day of the Saturnalia, when much
liceuce was granted ιο slaves in particular. Davus talres advantage of the permissiou
given him to abusa his master, and to taunt the rich witha slavery (to their passions
aud ιο ιιο world) harder aud more stupid than his owu. He also taunts Horace with
his instability aud weslruess oi purpose, which part of the Satire appears to me to be
the most natural aud amusing (sce note ou v. 23). The rest contains agreat deul that
is disagreeable aud much that is eommouplaee. It may perhaps represent the habit
αι’ talking trash under the name οι philosophy, which those who pretended ιο ιο of the
Stoic school hed established, aud the humour would bearuore perceptible ιο ο Roman
os the day thau itis now. ‘lto commentatore speal highly oi the wit οι this Satine,
bnt most of them make little distinction, and pmice ull elika.

There is no traee of a date iu the Satirc, but some think it probable that ss 8AE was
written st one Saturnalia, and this makes mention of the sume festival, and tonuhes
like the other upon Stoic doctrines, it was perhaps written a year atter the above. I
do not see any force iu this, nor does it appear necessary to suppose the Satira was
written at or near the Saturnalia. 'l'hat way of introducing the subject might have
suggested itscli at any time of the year.

Amanum.

I hare been loug a listener, my master, and though 1 wish ιο say a few words, 1 know
ruy position, and sm afraid.

ls that Davus?

Eveu so, Dawrs your indifferent guod slave.

Well, it’s the Saturnalia: γοα may speelr.

There are some men who are consistent in vie03 others who are always boveriug
between right und wrong. There’s Priscus, a man who changes every honr from
the sop ιο ιιο plain man, from the stately ιο ιιο ιαιαιιο, hom the ralre ιο ιιο
philosopher, the very type of mutability. Volunerius the gamester, when bc could
no longer hold the dice-box ior the gout, hired a boy to do it for him. But he in
his consisteucy was better off than the other mnu iu his inconsisteucy.

'l'o you.

What do you mean, seouudreli

Why γοα profess ιο praise the good old times, bat wonldn’t go baclr to them ii you
might. ln the town you plne for the country, in the country γοα cry up the town.
lr‘ you are uot iuvited out, γοα pretend you are glad to stay at home; if au invitation

Suppok 1 should prove thet you are sillier even than 1 your slave? Don't be augry,
and 1 will tell you what 1 have picked up at the philosophers.

'lhis man goes after his neighbour's wisa, I atter a common woman: which of us

γοα might ss well go hire yearaelf for s gladiatores submit to be tucked into a box
