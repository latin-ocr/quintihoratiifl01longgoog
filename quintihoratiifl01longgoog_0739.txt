⁸ (r. 158.) lf you went your plsy ιο succeed you must study the ehsrseters ot
did'crent eges: your child must ιο thoughtleoe end pleyt'ul3 your youth fond ol
manly sputis, open ιο temptetiou, intolerent of odrice, improvident, sspiring, snd¹
llekls5 your tull-grown mun must be centiens, looking for money end friends und
sdrsncemeut t while your old men is surrounded with troubles, ernrioious, nervom,
cold, prosrmtinsting, slew of hope, sluggish‚ gresdy of lile, morose, quernlous,
commending the former duys, s repr-over οι youth. For foer then of mining up the
differunt pmiods ol life, we shonid ιιι uttentiou upon the chsmcteristies of ench.

(v. 179.) The events must either poss npon the stege, or be told atter they ure orer.
What ic seen mslses more impression than whst is hesrd ; bnt still horrors end iucre-
dibls morsele ere not to bs trsnsucted on the stege A pley should be in ilve sets.
Nc god should ιο brought in without necessity. No fourth person shouldbe sllowed
to speuk. 'l'hs chorus should second the speakers, und should not sing whst is irrele-
ποι. It should fsvour nnd connsel the good, culm the μοοίοοιιο, commend
temperunce, justice, ohedieuce ιο ιιο lsws, end pesce 3 keep seorsis sud offer prayers
to the gods for mercy ιο ιιο efflicted end rengermcs on the tyrsnt.

(r. 202.) Once the dnts wss ο plsin instrument mede for theuso of the chorus, und not
ιο dll grest theotius, ss now. But this simple music changed when conquest end
luxury mixed up country end town. 'l'hen the huto-physo· strntted on the stege,
end the lyrs wss tnned to solemn sonnds, ιο pessinunte eloqnsnes, or oruculer struins.

(v. 220.) Boon aner ihegedy cume the Sntyric Drsms, when fun end grevity were
separated, snd the spectatore in the licence oi the honr were ιτοοιοᾱ with nest johe·
end norclties. But in these plsys too there must be no inconsistencies, such ss sgod
or hero coming down to tuvern-slsng or losing himself in fustisn, Trngedy should
more lihe ο modest end stetely metron among the Sstyrs. For 1 would not hunish
trsgic luugnsge altogether, so thst Silenus the god should tslk in the seme strsin
es Durus the slsre. 1 would adopt s familiar style, so thet sny oue should think he
could do it οι well till he mune to try. Funus must neither nik like city beunx nor
use low lengusge, lest they offend the better sort, though the vulger moy spplsnd.

(r. 251.) Δ short syllable followed hy s long melre sn ionibus, the rupidity of which
mede the nunnus pers ior s trimeter. At first ull the teetwere lembi, till ιο gire
more weudiness ιο ιιο verse spondees were admitted in the unsrcu feet. decius snd
Ennius neerly benished the inmbus altogether. 'l'his is ι ιιοι in thenu but it is not
every ons thet csn tell good versidcstion hom hed. Shsll 1 presumo upon this? or
shnll 1 write cautionsly‚ es if every nult would he detected? 'l'hus might 1 escape
blsme, bnt should wiu no prsiss.

(r. 268.) Tute the Greeks for your models end stndy them.

Why. your ssthers used ιο sdmire hoth the rhythm sud the wit of Plsutus.

Yes, stupidly enough, if we know the difference between courseness sud wit, snd cun
scsn s verm.

(r. 276.) Thespis is ssid to here invented Trsgedy, trevelling οιοοι with his wnggon,
end his sutore mueered with wine less. Then cume Aeschylus with mssk, robe, ⁵
cothurnus, end stage, end taught them to spesi grundly. After these the old
eomedy‚ which wss highly approved, till licenee wss nhused sud the lsw stepped in
sud silenced the chorus. Onr poete here been bold enough sometimes to quit the
Greeksnd celebratehome telesin trogodysnd eomedy‚ sudifthey were mors diligent,
istium would be as mighty in literature es in srms. Oh! my friends, iusve nothing

ιο sey ιο a poem which does not show msrlrs of esre end correction
(r. 295.) Because genimis ebore nrt, end ull poete, according ιο Democfitus, ure med,
msny let their neiis eud bound grow, effecting msdness. Fool thst I um ιο get rid
