Cinnam and was a neighbour and friend oi Virgil, through whom it ieprohcble Horace
mlle his acquaintance. He ie referred to (according to the Scholiaat who ie probably
ugit) in the Epistlc to the Pisas, v. lea sqq, aa a diaccrning critic ; and the language
there need ehowa that he waa dead when itwne written. 'I'he Scholiaat Acron rape, that

ARGUMENT.

What bounda ehall be aet tc our grief ior one eo decr? Teach ne a mourniul etrain,
‚ llelpomene. Can it be that Quintiliae, whose lilia Modeaty, J natica, Fidelitp, and
'iroth rhall not behold again, ia gone to his ererlaating reat i Many ia the good man
thet mourns him, but none more traly than thou, Virgil. ’Twaa not for thia thou
diist commit him to the care oi Heavcn. Bnt in vain thou doet aelr him back. Tho
ipre ci Orpheus could not bring back the blood to tha ahadowy form which hiercnry
bath gathcred into hell. 'Tia hard to bear: but patience melreo that lighter which
mpcwcr can change.
