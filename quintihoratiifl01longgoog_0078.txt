38 HORA'PII FLACCI

riou, whom· Lambinus follows, supposes Horace isaddresaiug himself ιο the fesrs ef
Brutus, and dissuading him from renewiug the battle at Philippi, after the death of
Cassius-a strange time for writing verses after the manner of Alcaeus, and an unumsl
way for amilitery tribune to offer couuscl to his commender-inehief. Aaron supposes
Horace to be alluding ιο the designa of the republican party, under &rtur Pompeius.
This opinion is supported at some length by Buttmann, Mythol. i. 843 sq„ who argues
that the ship does not signify the commonwealth, for that Horace speaks as if be were
separated from the subject of the allegory: that ιο adriae the citizens to ubsmiu from
civil wara (represented by the sea), because they were in acrippled condition, weuldbeto
imply that they might engage iu them if they were not in that condition ς also thatthere
would be no propriety in representing the state as a dismasted shipin thetimeef Augus
tus. He therefore considers that all this refers tethe efforts of the brokenbnt retis!
party te which Horace bad been lately attached torepair their fortunas underthelesdinss

Philippi. ‘ Pontica pinus' he considers a very masterly allusion ιο Pompey the Great, as
the conqueror of Mithridates, which is Acron'a opinion. I give this theory in defereuee
ιο the author, who has few equale iu critical sagacity, and who in the essay in which
these viewa are put forward has done good service tothe interpretation of Horaceonthe
principles of common sense. Isbould mention however that the theory has but fer
supportare, of whom Gesner certainly is oue, and his was no mean judgment. Passer
is another. bhanlse cannot sufficiently express his astonishment at Buttmann's strange
doctdne. Hawing made up his mind thet none of the odes in these three boch were
written before Actium, amc. 723, he adopts the opinion of Torrentius, blason. Saua-
don, and others, that Horace wrote this ode at the time when Augustus was thinking ol
retiring from the head of affairs (auo. 725), and when be was dissuaded by llaeoeuas
in a speechin which he likened thestatc to a reesel tostupon the wetere withoutapilot
(Dion Cass. 52. 16). It does not seem to hareoccurred ιο Franks, that supposing the
historiun tc bare related the actual words of Maecenas, which is somewhat improbable .
it is aa likely he gothis imagefrom Horace as Horace from Maecenas. But the image
was common and always will be, and it is aa plain as possible that Horace gothis
