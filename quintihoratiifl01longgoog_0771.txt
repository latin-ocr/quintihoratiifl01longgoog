The reading in tho text is ‘Scribo decom Nerio‚’ and ii thatis the true reading, the

explanation in the notes may be aa good as any other. But os tho reading ‘acribo
decem a Nerio' has tho better authority, wo must attempt to explain it. Thereis no
occasion to show here that ‘decem' means a snm of money. Τιιιὶι proved clearly in
tho note on S. ii. 8. 69, ond by Krhgor in a useful excusam on this passage. Tho expla-
nation oi Orelli and Ritter that ‘decem’ means ‘decem tabulas’ is a mistake which
we oould hardly expect auch excellent commentatore ιο make.

We must next consider what ‘acribo a Norio’ means. 'dhe proposition ‘ ub ' is thus
used in a passage oi Cicero (pro Flacco, c. 19, quoted hy Krliger), ‘Si praetor dedit, ut
est scriptum, a quaestore numeravit3 quaestor a mensu publico; mensa ant ex vectigali
aut ex tributo :' which mouns, tho praetor pald by nn order on the quaestum the qnae·
ster gave au order on the publio benk, and finally tho bank paid the money ont οι
ιιι funda which it had in possession, The passage iu Livy (24. c. 18, ‘a quaestore
perscribebatur ') may aleo be eompnred with this in Horace.

'l'ho conclusion is that ⁴ acribo decom a Nerio' expresses u poyment of money made by
the hanker Norint to some hormwer, and made paranant to tho order οι some lauder,
who may be Perillius (v. 74, ‘Perilli dictantis qnod tn numquam rescribere possis').
Tho entry in the books of Nerius of the loan made on the order οι Perillins would be
cridenoo against tho borrowor, for tho entry would be made with his knowledge and
eonsent- Δι ‘scribere' here expresses the leudingof the money, ιο ιιιιιιιιιιι ’ expresses
the ropayment5 for the evidence of the ropayment would be an entry in tho books
which would have ιιι effect oi annulling the entry of the deht.

1r it should be ssked to whom is tho word ‘scribe' addresaed, ιο thelenderor the
bos-rower, ιιι uuswer ia that it is not necessary to suppose the word ιο ιι ιιιιιιιιιι to
either. It means no more than ‘suppose Nerius to advance a anm of money to a bor-
rower upon the order of a lender! Further, ‘supposes hundred written wenritiee
besides, sueh securities ιι wilp Cicuta employa? All these words in ιιι aooond person,
‘scribe' ‘adde’ ‘rapies' ‘tn rescribere possis' mustbeinterpreted generally: ‘suppose
the money lent ι’ ‘suppose ιιι additionnl written seerrities ς’ ‘suppose the debtor brought
into court ;' and lastly, in ‘tu nunquam rescribere possia’ ‘tn’ is Damasippus or any
man who borrows and does not ropay.

A like use of ‘ addo’ occurs in S. ii. 8. 321, ‘adde poemata nuno!

'l'he passage, though it is difficolt and hos given the commentatum much trouble, is
perieotly plain, is we look at it in the right way. Krdger’s is tho only true explanation
that 1 have soen. G. Ia. ·
