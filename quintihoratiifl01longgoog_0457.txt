SATIRARUM Ι. 9.

SATIRE IX.

'I'nis satire, which ιι J'ustly popular for humour and great dramatio power, has an
historiosl valuc ss showing, undeuignedly but more clearly then almost anJ do-
scription oould do, the charsotm of Horace. It puts the man before us aa in ι
picture.

He represent· himself es seuntering alone and early on tho Sacra Via, when ι person
ιι ιιιιι ιο more than by name, a forword coxoomt, comes up familiarlJ and falls into
conversation with him, to his greet annoyance, for he wanted ιο be alone and knew tha
sellow’s character. Horace does his best to shake him off, but he is ιοο emiable to copo
with the effrontery of his campanica, whose objectis to get through Horace an intro·
duction to Maecenas, with whom the poet must therefore have been known ιο be on
tenus of intimacy at the time this Satira was written The msu's vulgarity end want
of tect aro conspicuous throughout the scene; while Horace exhibite in every part good
braediug and en amiable temper ; end though he is tried ιο ιιι utmost by reflectione on
his putron aud his friends, he is incapable of sapiug a rude word, is taken off his guard
contiuually, and is amusingly consciens of his inferiority to tho man of insolenoe on his
own ground. ἰιι effect of this pictura is heightened by the introduction towards the
sud of the soene of Fuscus Aristius, an old friend of the poet, and a man of the world,
who, like Horace, understood character, bnt had that sort of moral courege and promp·
tituds which his friend wanted. The rmdiuoss with which he takes up the joke und
enters into Homoe’s absurd position, and the despair ιο which his desertion reduoes the
poet, are highly ludienous.

If proof wera wanting that the charactersof men end thewst of the world are little
affected hy the lapsa of centurias, this Sstire would alios-d it. llook upon it as the
most genisl and characteristic of all Horace’s productione. If we wanted ιο form sn
atinate uf the men, I do uot think we could go to any other part of his works with .

orire, feeble compared with his perception of, ιιι abilityto describe, ι scene of dramatio
humour like this. If he had lefs us only this amusing poem ιο judge by, his genius
aeuld hare ιιιιιι high, aud the gooduess of his natura would hare bean scknowledgcd
ιι ιιι. Like our amiable poet Oowper, Horace appears as a satirist of humen life and
uf the' moes of society, but both are too gentle for that rough work, ιιι shine most ιι
menes of quaint humour ιιι inoffensius fun. As respecta Horace ιι least, let any one
read this Satira and judgo for himself.
