OARMEN XXXII.

This ode hes caused the commentatore much trouble. Whether 11 was meant to be
en introduction to some poem Horece wrote or intended to write cn one oi' the events
of the day, or what sort cf song he was mked lor and by whom, arc all questions that
heve been freely discussed. The question turns in the lirst instance on the word with
which the ode begins. The Scholiasts reed ‘Poscimur,' on which Acron’s comment ie
‘poscebatur dicte sue adcre3' Porphyrion's ‘Erigitur e nohis ut cauumrre! But a
large number of 1188. have ‘Poscimus,’ which Bentley adopts ester Lambinus aud all
tho older editions. (Gruquius, however, following his Blandinien MS, reads ‘Posci-
mur.') With that reading the ode becomes e mere invocetion oi the hinec, which would
snit eny poem or eny subject. With ‘Poecimur,' which Ι heve followed most of the
modern editors in edopting, there is 01111 00 0100 whatever to the occasion of the ode,
and the Scholiasts' remarks do not help us. I see no munds for biumbres supposi-
tion that ou some important occasion Horace was celred to write a poem, aud wrote thie
short ode to deprecate euch ademend, eud to show that hie mueewae not suited to such
themee. I have uo doubt ‘poscimur’ is the true reading, eud it mey menn merely that

the poetic ‘afflatus’ was on him. Tho abruptncm of the opening favoure thet notion.
