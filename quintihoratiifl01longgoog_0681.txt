Quid de quoque viro et eui dicas saepe videto.

Nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures,
Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.
Non ancilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae
Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat.
