HORATII FLACCI
GARMEN XIX.

Glycera (Γλυκέρα) is one of Horaoe’s favourite names. She is setdown as the om
of C. iv. le. 21 (see n), hut with what show of reason, beyond their having the esum
number ot' syllables, itis not easy ιο see. We need not talre Herses too much st his
word when be says that his days of love were over. Many e young sentinsenislist hss
imagined this sud found himself mistalsen ss the poet appears to have done. ‘lhos
who choose ιο insist that lloruee is oonfecsing on his own account thet “the heydsy of
his blood was tnmcd,” put this ode rather lete, ano. 7290r 730. Others lind in tho
allusion to the Parthian (v. 12) occasion ιο fix the dete a few years later (734 οι· 735),
when the stendmds ot Crassus hed been recovered stom that troublesome enemy. This
important epoch ie ever before the minds of one section of the chronologists: “dise
noctesque quidem veluti spectris territi cogitassent de signis et captivis ι. 734 a Parthis
Augusto redditis,” says Franks, whose acumen, however, while it has led him on thr
whole into s more consistent end probable chronological schenm thau Kirchuer sud
others, is not ebore being misled by too much zesl for its own inventione 1 should he
uomere disposed with him ιο say Horace wrote this ode while the Arabim expedition

When or under what circumstances or ιο whom (if any body) he wrote, we mna be
content to be ignorant. (See G. iv. 1, Introduction.)
