ln the year of the cibyrae an army was sent into Arabia Felix by Augustus undu
Ashur Gallus, who was governor of Egypt. 'I'he force chiefly consisted ot troops sta·
tioned in that province (Strabo. p. 819: ritanus Aiksos μέρει τῆς trkiyimp φρουρᾶς eis ¹
τὴν Ἀραβίαν egenen and p. 780); but the prospect of wealth the expedition held out,
from the indefinite knowledge then possessed of tbe country, attracted young meust ς
Romaand inducsd, it would seem, Iccius,a man ofstudious habits, tojcin it The ex·
pedition was attended with disaster, aud the greater part cf the force perished. Iccius Q
survived, and we find Horace writing ιο him a few years later as Agrippa’s steward iu l
Sicily (hipp. i. 12). Beyond this nothing is known of Iccius hluch has beau said
about his being avarioious, and that is the opinion of the author os his life iuths
Biographical Dictionary usually referred ιο iu these notes, who says that both iu Ἴ
this ode aud tho epistla “ Horace reprehende pointedly but delicately in Iccius an inor·
dinate desire l'or wealth.” 1 do not think this idea would bave presented itselt to so
many minds ii the Scholiasta had not made such remarks as these: “Ad Iccium
scribit quem miratur philosophiae intermisso studio repente se ad militarem vitam l
contulisse cupiditate divitiarum.”-“ Parsimoniam laudat cum mordacitate '’ (Aaron).
“Per quod videtur concupiscere divitias Arabum.''-“ Inconstantiae reprehendit qui
per arentiam philosophiae studium militia mutarit'' (Porphyrion). Such remarks
prove nothing and throw no light upon Horace’s meaning. The pointisnot worth
discussing as respects tho unknown Iccius ς bnt the characteres the ode is lost in this
view of it. Itis apiacaof good-tempered jocular irony, of which the point lies iu
the man of books going forth as a conqueror ιο subdue heroe nations untamed before,
audtoreturn laden with the spoils of the East. Iccius mayheve been of a restlea ¹
character and not easily satisfied with his position, if we may judge of the language oi
the epistler bnt that scarcely ah'ects the spirit ol this ode, iu which there does not
appear ιο be any thing serious expressed or intended. Later times hare seen young 1
and chiralrous men bastening to an El Dorado in expectation of wealth aud dis·
tinction, and finding nothing but disappointment, aud such appears ιο hare been the l
case ou the occasion of this expedition into Arabia.
