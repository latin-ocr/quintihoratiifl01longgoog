’ 184 HORATII FLACCI

OARMEN XVII.

‘l'be short ode, 0. i. 26, and this ode vere addrassod to the same person. la Aelius
Lamia (see Introduction to 0. i. 26). The lauguagc of the former ode bas led totbs
interanea that Lamia was a young msn oi desponding disposition, ssd this that hs sss
proud and vain-glorious-asort of oritioism impertinentsnd unrensonsble as it seem to
me. What is clear is no more than that lamia vas a young man ot goodbirth laiug ot
the Aelia gens, who vvere plebeians, bnt asold standing. Like otherfamilles the lamiae
were perhaps glad totraoo their origin to a fabulosa hero, and believed their founder to
be Lamus, ling of the laestrygonians, the builder ot Formiae, hom whence tbey mas
have migrnted to Rome (ses lest ode, v. 33 n). Horace had evidently au affection tot
the young man lamis, whose father vvas a friend ot OEccro, and died rich. It is not
improbable the ode vvas written at his house in the country, whether st Formiae (“quod
valde probabile‚'’ says J sui, 1 don’t see why) or elsewhere. It has no particular merit.
and could have cost Horace little labour. Hamust have written many such that have
never been published, ond these two odes were probably included in the collection ont
of compliment to Lamia. But there is not the least reason vvhy Horace mont bs sup

better, without the verses 2-5, which some editors would strihe ont (ani says, “ haud
dubie spurii sunt,'’ and has a long exeamus to prove it), but no MSS. omit, it is cs
very worst species of criticism that endeavours to bring, by corrections, omissions, aad
additions, the received text into conformity with some standard which is presuncd to
represent the mind and style ottho author. ll' this system vero not so οοωιοοο, ομ·
cially among the commentatore ot Horace, old and new, it vvould seam superfluous to
say avvord about it. Lamia hsd a brother Quintus, who died early, totbe great grisias*
Lucius (hipp. i. 14. 6). Thera was one of this family, according to the Scholiasta Ausa
and Porphyrion, who wrote oomedies 3 but there is no reason to suppose it vm Honcs's
friend. In two passages Juvenal alludes to the lamiae as a asmily of distinctiva (S
