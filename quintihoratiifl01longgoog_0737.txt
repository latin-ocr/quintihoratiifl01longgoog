'l'mr is no sufficient internel evidence 11 the time when thie poem wne written or
of tbe persons 71 whom 17 is addreesed. They 116 three in number, a father and 7111
sons. Porphyrion and 0111111. Crnq. say 71117 the father is L. Calpurnius Frso 011180·
111111, wbo was Praefectus Urbi under 'liberius (Tae. Anu. ri. 10). 11 this bc so, as he
m born in att-o. 705, and hed 17 71111 time a eon verging 117 lecet on menbood (for
to no other would this sort 11 instruction be eddresoede ses v. 366), the poem must
11116 been written very shortly before the doeth of Horace, 111. 746. Orelli and
Kircbner, and meuy others, take this view 11 the date. 111716, 11111111, and many
before them, put 1761111111, end in that case a different Piso must be 1111111111. ’1111
person supposed by tbe sdrocates 1111 earlier (117111 Gn. Calpurnius Piso, who
belonged 71 the party of Brutus and Cassius, and fought together with Horace 17
Philippi. He had 1 eon who was consul 1111. 717, end if 1161111 the youth referred
to, tbeArsPoetiee must 1111111661 written a good rosny yesre before. But 7116 question
ie one it is impossible 71 decide, aud nothing 71111 upon it for the understanding 117116
poem, which, like many othere, might be addreesed to any body3 though 1 donet agree
with those who suppose Horace bad no particular persons in mind. The Pisones abore
referred to are numbered 8, 22, 23, in the Diot. Biog.

Δι 71 7116 purpose of the poem 1 11111 tried to help the render in jndging for himself
byn oarsfol 1111111111 the Argument. It will be 1611 thet 7111 11161 are miscellaneoue
and bsre little or no method, and 71117 tbe history of Ponto-y which 1111111 gives ie
more 11111111 7111111611. 17 is impossible to look upon it 11 adniehed poem. We ere
carried from precept 71 history, end from one sort 11 poetry to another without
warning t and though agenorei connexion rnny be trnced between the principles of one
kind 111111 those of another, no pnins are taken to separate the rules that belongto each.
'l'be roles end history 11 the Dromo ere chiefly dwelt upon, with what particular
bearing upon Romen pootry itis not easy 71 see. Mnch thet ie seid 111 hare no refer·
enee to 1717111111 could efford 11 instruction 71 11111111. The observatione on
this subject 111 interrupted now and then by irrelevant observatione, end on the whole
there 611 111 little doubt either thet the Ars Poetice was published efter Horeoe's
deetb, 11711 fragments clumsily put together, or 71117116 publiehed it himself 1171111
oareless way from that 1111117111 indolence which prerented his ever producing e eom·
plete work 11 any length, 1111 which is seen in the abruptness with which several 11
his pieces ere brought 71 111111. Attempts 1111611161 mede to rc-arrange the 11171-
riuis so 11 71 form a perfect whole, but the 1111111111 doing eo do 117 exist. ’1116 plnoe
11111 invariably assigned 71 the 1111 Poetica was 111117 given it by Η. Stephens. 111 the
1118. eud earlier 1111711111 17 ie 1111117111 before 7111 Satires. Some editore 7111717111
