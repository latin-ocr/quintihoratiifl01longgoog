CARMEN SAECULARE. 267

Augur et fulgente decorus arcu
Phoebus acceptusque novem Camenis,
Qui salutari levat arte seem

Corporis artus,
Si Palatinas videt aequus arces

Remque Romanam Latiumque, felix
Alterum in lustrum meliusque semper

Proroget aevum.
Quaeque Aventinum tenet Algidumque,
Quindecim Diana preces virorum 70
Curet et votis puerorum amicas

Applioet aures.
