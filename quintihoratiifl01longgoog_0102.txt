62 HORATII FLACOI

OARMEN XXVIII.

A great deal hes been written about this ode, as to the spirit aad pnrport of it, the
occasion of its composition, the persons introduced, and the parts they respectirely bear.
The more literally we teks the ode aad the less we search for hidden mmnings, or attempt
to fix the dete or the cause that led ιο the train of thought, themora likely we arel
conceive, to arrive at the true bearing of the ode. Septimius, one of Horace'a mest
intimate friends, had a villa at Tarentum (C. ii. 6), where it is likely Horace on some
occasion, if not often, paid him a visit. It seems to ms not improbable that he may bare
seenabody cast on shore et that place where the scens appears to bs laid. The sight of
this body might naturally suggest such an ode as this, in which the spirit of a ship-
wrecked man is introduced moreHzing upon death andgasking for burial. His reflectiom
take the foma, in the first instance, of an address ιο Archytae the philosopher, whose
name was associated with Tarentum, and he joina with him other worthies‚ whose wis·
dom and greatness had not saved them from ths common lot of all. There may have
been e legend that Archytas was buried on the ‘litus Matinum,’ generally supposed to
be a part of the range of Mons Garganus in Apulia. Possibly a tomb was οιοπιι there
that was said to be his. But it does not follow that the speaker was there. The name
of Archytas would be suggested by his association with Tarentum, where I think (from
v. 29) the scene is laid, and the name of such a man is naturally connected aith the
reflectione of this ode, even independently of his connexion with the place That
Archytas was shipwrscked on s voyage down the Hadriatic (which is the general
opinion) has been too hastily assumed hom this ode. If he wasreally buried attha
foot of Mons Garganus, there are other ways of acoonnting for it. But the fastis Ι
not proved.

The ode has the appearance st lirst sight of a dialogus, aad the great majority ef i
commentator-s take it in that way. Thongh differing from others as to the division of i
the dialogus, which I thought should take placo in the middle of tbe fifteenth asrael '
was once of the same opinion myself. Ihave now changed that opinion, andbeliers, i
with Hottinger and others, quoted by Orelli in his Excursus, that it is nodialogue Ι
at all, which view l sm ths more disposed to adopt, because it is supported hythe i
judgmsnt of my friend Mr. Long. Those who hold this opinion are divided in their i

interpretation. Oasaubon affirmsd that the ode was merely the poet’s medItation npcn
the fate of Archytas and ou the destiny of all great men: followed by an appeal, on ἶ
the part of Archytas, for burisl (I suppose at v. 21). Ldbker andReselthink Ηοιιοεί
ghost is speaking under the fauciful notion that he himself had been drowned od
Palinurus (C. iii. 4. 27). G. Fabricius supposed the shade of Archytas ιο be speaking
throughout. Hottinger (Opusc. Phil. Lips. 1817) and Weiske (Jahn. Annal. Phil.
1830) held the view that I hare adopted, except that they supposed the unfortunate
man, whose body is lying unburicd, is speaking at the tomb of Archytas on the pro-
montory of Matinum. I see no occasion for that, and think the subiect of the odeis
more likely to have been suggested at Tarentum than any where else The words '
‘Neptuno custode Tarenti' seems to lix the scene. If Archytas was buried, or sup·
posed to bs buried, at Matinum, it would be natural for one who thought of tha
narrow space ιο which his greatness was reduced ιο mention the spot where bis bones
lay. But it does not appear why a person speaking at Matinum should talk of
Neptune particularly as the ‘custos Tarenti’

These who consider that the whole ode consiste of a dialogus between a sailor and
Archytas divide it either after v. 6, or v. 16, or v. 20. They who make the marlnsr
, ceass to speak at r. 6, do so chiefly, because the subjecta that follow that verse are sup·
posed to be above a speaker of his class. But, as that would becontradicted by Archytas
appeal to his judgmsnt in v. 14, it has been proposed to alter 'te' into ‘me' or ‘se'
