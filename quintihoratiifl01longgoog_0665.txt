EPISTOLARUM I. 16. 625

Frigidior Thracem nec purior ambiat Hebrus,
Infirmo capiti fluit utilis, utilis alvo.

Hae latebrae dulces, etiem si credis amoenae,
Incolumem tibi me praestant Septembribus horis.

Neve putes elium sapiente bonoque beatum,

Dissimules‚ donec monibus tremor incidet unctio.
Stultorum incurata pudor molus ulcera celet.

Si quia bello tibi terra pugnata marique

Dicat et his verbis vacuas permulceat aures:
