EPISTOLARUM 1. 11.

EPISTLE XI.

This llpistle is addressed to one Bullatius, of whom we lrnow nothing. Ha was
travelling in the Aegean and in haia Minor, and was absent longer than Horaoa
wished, or thought good for him; and the object of thia letter is to induce him

to return. Tha commentatore generally have a very mean opinion of Bullatius,
who has suffered at their hands harvler measure than any of Horaoe's friends.
But his chief viae seems to have been a fondness for travelling, and aa aspecial

admiratione? some of the duest and most ancient towns in the world. If we ara
to add to thia that for some reason or other he was unhappy, and expected to
relieve himself by change of sceno, he may have been mistaken in his means, bnt
if ao, plenty of peopla have shared in his mistalrs and when Horace puts before
Ballntins as the end of life the enjoyment of tho present moment-a doctrine he
seems to have held pretty strongly,-we may doubt whether hia philosophy ia aot
at least as bad as his friend's practice. But wa need not assume any thing injurious
to Bullatiua Such reflectione upon travel aa occur in this Epistls might naturally
have suggested themselves whomsoever it had been written to. We mast not jndge
Horace’s Epistles aa we would private letters, meant only for tha reading of the
persons they are written to.
We have ao means of knowiag when the Epistle was written.

What think yon, Bullatius, of the lina places of the Eastl' are they not all tama
compared with our Campus and Tiberi Have you aet your heart upon one of
Attalus’ towns, or are you so tired ot' travelling that yon must settle down at
Lebedus, the dullest of places, as γοο know? And yet Ioould live there will·
ingly, leonissa, forgetting home and every body, to look out upon the stormy aea.
But the travaller who turns in to his tarem to raet would aot stay there for ever ς
and he who wsrms himself by the flre or a hot both does not male these the and
of hia life. So if you have been tempest-tost‚ and have been glad ti· pat into port,
is that any raason why yon should sell your ship aad never come back? 'lhose
parts are very well for siok people, but as long aa health aad fortune let yon be at
Rome, stay here and praise Samos and the rest at a distance Be thankful for tho
blansings of tha day, and live for the present hoar3 ao will you ba happy whatever
place you may he in. ”lis reason that takes away sorrow, aad we only change onr
clima when we shift our place. It is but a hnsy idlness that employa aa when we
aeek happiness in ships aud in conches. All you wantis hereoratdallUlabrae, if
your heart ba hue aad fail you not.
