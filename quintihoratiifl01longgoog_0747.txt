Ans POETICA.

Et pugilem victorem et equum certamine primum
Et juvenum curas et libera vina referre.
Discriptas servare vices operumque colores

Cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta solutor?

Cur nescire pudens prave quam discere malo?
Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult 3
Indignatur item privatis ac prope socco

Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thyestae.
Singula quaeque locum teneant sortita decenter.
Interdum tamen et vocem comoedia tollit,
Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore 3

Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri 95
Telephus et Peleus, cum pauper et exsul uterque
