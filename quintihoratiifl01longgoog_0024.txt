xvi PREFACE.

Perhaps nearly all the learning that is necessary for the explanation
ol the text has been collected¹3 and future editors will do the best
service by applying to the interpretation of the text the knowledge ¹
which their predecessore have transmitted.

Bentley often employed the method of interpretation to determine
the true reading 3 and he thought that the reason of the case and
the matter (ratio et res ipsa) were sometimes stronger than a hun·
dred manuscripta, as he says in a note on C. iii. 27. In his note
on v. 5 cf this Ode, he maintains that ‘rumpit’ for which there is
evidence, is better than ‘rumpat’ for which there is also evidence,
whether more or less,1 do not know. According to Ritter, the
evidence is for ‘rumpat’ This isjust an instance which tries a
man's power, if he will venture to give reasons, and Ι think that
Bentley’s argumentis opposed by the ‘ratio et res ipsa? Bentley
says that ‘rumpat’ is quite contrary tc that which precedes (ducat,
dcc), for it would he a lncky thing for the wicked tc break off the
journey which they had begun, a lucky thing to return home when
they have discovered that they are setting out inauspieiously. The
sense of the whole passage then, as he thinks, is this:ss“11et
certain evil omens accompany the wicked. A serpent also is
wont to interrupt a journey which has been planned.” This isa
very feeble addition to the first stanza; and if we take ‘rumpit’ as
Bentley does, it means that a serpent interrupte any person’s j0ur-
ney, whether hc is bad or good. But the subsequent words, ‘ego
eui timebo,’ are addressed to Galatea, and‘all that precedes ought to
apply to the wicked3 and Horace prays that bad luck may go with
them, when they do go, and thata bad sign may break off a journey
which they have planned3 and this is the same as saying, may they
not be able to go where they intend tc go. There is no contradic-
tion here. It is not so easy to decide on the other passage (v. 15),
whether we should read ‘vetet’ or ‘ vetat? Ritter has ‘rumpat'
‘ vetat ε’ Keller has ‘ rumpit,' ‘ vetet’ There is said to be only one

¹ Horace contains many words which have a technical meaning: they are words ot'
art. There is one which l intended to notice, but have omitted, the word ‘forins'
(hipp. i. 16. 4), which, iu the language of the agrimensoresds a plan of a pisce of land,
eut on broune, and perhaps sometimes another material.
