EPISTOLARUM Ι. 7. 587

Designatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,

Officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis

Adduoit febres et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet

Contractusque leget 3 te, dulcis amice, reviset

Cum Zephyris, si concedes, et hirundine prima.

Non quo more piris vesci Calaber jubet hospes

'ru me fecisti locupletem. “ Vescere sodes.” ιι
“ J am satis cst.” “'At tu qnantum vis 'colle’' “ Benigne.”
