SATIRE VI.

ln addition ιο the obloquy brought upon him by his satires, Horace, after his intimacy
with Maecenas was known, had to meet the envy sach good fortune was sure ιο excita
llio birth would furnish a handle for the enrious, and he was probably called an upstart
and hard names of that sort. In this satire, which is nothing but an epistle to

Maecenas he spurna tha idea of his birth being anyohjection to him, while at the Ἰ

mma tirne he argues sensibly against men trying to get beyond their own legitimata
sphera, and aiming at honours which are only attended with inconvenienoe fatiguo,
and ill will. This satire, besides the good senae and good feeling it contraius, is valuable
as bearing upon Horace's life. His introduction te Maecenas is told contisely but
l'ally and with much propriety and modesty; and nothing can be more plessiug than
the filial affection and gratitudo shown in those parts that relate to his father and the
εάοοιιίοο he gave him. Hs takes pleasurc in referring whatever merite he might have
tethin good parent, as he did in the fourth Satire.

The Satira theu may be supposed to have been written chiefly for the purpose of dis·
arming easy, by showing the modesty or the suthor's protensione, and the circum·
etsnees that led lo lais intimacy with Maecenas. 'l'he views of publio life which it
mntains were no doubt sincere, and tho daily routine described at the end was better
suited to Homce’s habit of mind than the insigues and anxietiea of office. 'l'here is
not tho least appearance in any of his writings of his having been spoilt by his good
fortune and hy his intercourse, on terms of rare familiarity, with Augustus Maecenas,
aod otham and probably malignity never attached any ons less deserving of attacls
than Horace. There is ne great vigom· or variety in this piece, and ita chief velue is
betorica Atternpts hove been made to ax a date for the composition, but when
l'rrnke says that because Horace declares he might ride to Tarentum if hc liked on a
ursle, without attracting any notice, therefore he must lately have been at Tarentum,
and must hare written this Satira shortly aher the fifth, and makes his calculatione
turn chiefly on this point, it may be inferred that there are no sullldent data for
terming any thing like a definite opinion on the subject.

ARGUMENT.

lhough the blood of kings down in your veins, Maecenas, you despiso not the humbly
beru, such as myself ι freedrnan's son. lt matters nothing to you who a man's
father was, if he be but a freeman born, knowing well that King lullus, ay and
many before hhu, though they had ne anoestors, were honest men ; while laevinus,
whose amathas expelled the Tarquini, is not worth an as, eren in the judgmeut of
t populace that stupidly worships ancestry. And we who are so far above them,
how shall we judgei Allow that they prefer a heduus with his ancoetors to a
Decius who had none, and that the censor might degrada ene who should aspira ιο
the aenate without being free horn, that need not alter our y'udgment The censor
would sot right if he did so ς ιιι every man keep his own place. But high and low
are all willing captives following in the truin cf glory. What heve you to do, lillius,
te rmumc your tribuneship and your bedge? Yon are only drawing more envyon
your head. The moment a mon puts on a senators dress, ‘⁸ Who is this ?’' says oue.
‘⁴ Who was his father i '’ says another. As the fop who lllres ιο be thought handsome
nakes all the girls concas to examine his features, his anolo, hia foot, his teeth, hia
hair, so tha placaman hears on all hands, “ Who was his father? what was his
mother? What you, the son of a slave, do you take upon yourself ιο put citizens to
