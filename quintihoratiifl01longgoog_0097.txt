· GARMllN XXV.

Resides thie there are two other odes (iii. 15, iv. 13), the subject oi which isthe wan·
tonuere of fnded benuties, a subject probably handlcd with still greater pungency by
Archilochus, for it was unehis earcesm would find scopein und wouldbe likely to fustus
upon. lt is impossible to say whether Horace had any individual in his mind when he
wrote any ct* these odes. Ithc had, we need not go further and suppose that he wrote
cs c disappointed lover. For instance, Jeni’s indignation at the virulence with which,
llorucecun find it in his heart to attach (O. iv. 13) the woman he was ao fond of (C. iii. 9)
seems to be nnnecessary. But it ie a sair specimen os thot matter-otiam school of in·
terpretction. Ihave before had occasion tu remark, how the sume principle is applied
to Lydia and how rnuny new lights she appears in (C. 13. Introduction).

ARGUMENT.

Thy windows ure no longer assailed und thy elumbem broken by saucy youths3 thy
door turus no more ou its hinges ; the serenade is silent. Now ’tis thy turn, in some
lone ulley on a durlr night, with the winter wind blowing and thy heurt on fire with
lust, to cry ior lovers, and complain that young blood goes after the tender plant and
bide the old leuues go dont upon the Hebrus.
