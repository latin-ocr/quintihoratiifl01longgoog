CARMINUM l. 28. 6³

though meet even of those who divide the colloquy οι v. 6 have overlooked this dith-
oulty, aud aoeepted ‘te’ on the authority of the hlSS. But ‘nauta' ie not properly a
mmuuou sailm, but ‘naviculariae’ e shipmaeter. “ Nautam accipere debemus eum qui
navem marcet: quamvis nonme appellantur omnes qui navis navigandus cansa in nave
eunt Sed de exercitore solummodo Praetor sentit ” (Dig. 4. 9. 1. ξ 2). Τιο ‘exercitet’
is the parson who chariore the ship. There dum not seem ιο ιο any natural division at
v. 16, and for Archytas to begin (at v. 21) with ‘hle quoque devexi,' doc, nothing
having gone before with which ιο connect those words, is also unneturnl ; while, if we
understand him tcbeginhis reply οι ‘Sed ornnes una menetnor,’wehavean'oppos1ti0n
mtween the sarcasm cf the tirst speaker (who says ironieully οι those thot espired ιο
connexion with the gods and ιο the highest order of wiedom that they hed not escaped
death, not even Pythagorae, though he pretended ιο have done ec once) and the grave
both, solemnly propounded by the philosopher, that all must die, wiee end rinuvino, old
end young, on land or at seu, und illustrated by hie own ease. 'l'hie was once my
opinion, aud se many will still sdhere to the theory of ιιο dialogus and Archytas' ship-
reos, 1 have put thet theory iuwhat appears ιο me the beet form. Τιο other espla-
nutionoi the ode, however, Ι feel little doubt, is in the main ιιο true one. Another, to
ehieh Orelli inclined (though he suspended hie judgment on the whole question), eup-
puees usailoe coasting along the Apuliae shore and eeeing ιιο tomb of Archytae, where·
span ιο breaks out into the addrees ‘Te murie,' hc, from v. lto ιθ. Tben the ghoet
oi ι lstely shipwneolued man comes forwsrd and prays for alittle send. It would be
difficolt to imagine any circumstances that could have suggested euch a scene, especially
aith so abnupt s change of persone. The sudden apparitiou osu ghoet eehcing back ιο
ιιο meriner st sea his own words ιο my mind sppcurs almost ludicrous.

One difficulty appears ιο me ιο ιο fatal tc the notion ofa dialogue, and that ie con·
taiued iu the second aud third venem, in which it appears ιο ιο clearly intimated that
the body oi Archytas bes already received that which he ie supposed so earnaetly ιο
pray tora for though many, 1 am avare, get over this difficulty by supposing ‘cohibent
muuera' ιο mesu that the want os ιιο scanty gift of a little earth was lueepiug him
herl from his rest, 1 do not seo how the words will beer that sense, nor can Itranslate
‘mhubeut' with Dillenbr. and othere, se if it was meant that hie body occupied but ο
small εροοο ou the suriaco of the greum. The words can only mean that he was under
the and, whether partially or otherwise, and ln either case he would not require dust
to be east three times on him.

This consideration, ue well se the unity and simplicity it gives ιο ιιο ode, hae induoed

ute, with much confidenca to adopt the explanation 1 have εἰνοιι. Τιο propriety of s ·

ses-isring person being appeeled ιο consiste in his being exposed ιο risk of ιιο saum
deust the person who eppeals to him.

ARGUMEN'I'.

Euan thee, thou measurer oi earth and ees, thou countm of the nude, Archytae, how
usuali a portion of earth contains thee now! It protits ιιοο not to have searcbed the
sir sud msereed the haerens since thou wart ιο die. Sc Tantalus, Tithonus, und
llinos heve died, aud Pythagorae too with all bis learning heth gone down once more
lotha grave. But eo it is: all must die alihe; some ιο mehe apertior Mars, some
mhuwedup in the deep: old eud young go crowdiug ιο ιιο grave: none escape: I
ιοο inve peu-iahed in the wetere. But grudge me not, thou marines, a handful oi
een: so may the stou-m spend itoelf on the woode while thou art safe and thy mer·
claudize increaees. Is it a small matter with thee to bring rain cn thy children?
Yet, perhaps retribution uwaits thyeeli ι my cureee will be heard, and theu no etone·
nent shall deliver thee. 'Tie but the work of a moment-thrice caet earth upon une.
md hasten ou.
