EPISTOLARUM Ι. 6. orl

Nn. admirari prope-res est una, Numici,

Solaque quae possit facere et servare beatum.

llunc· solem et stellas et decedentia certis

Tempora momentis sun't qui formidine nulla

Imbuti spectent: quid censes munera terrae,

Quid maris extremos Arabas'dicantis et Indos,

Ludicra quid, plausus ct amici dona Quiritis,

Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore?

- Qui timet his adversa fere miratur eodem

Quo cupiens pacto; pavor est utrobique molestus3 lo
Improqis‘a simul species exterret utrumque.

Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne, quid ad rem,

Si quidquid vidit melius pejusve sua spe,

Delixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet?

Insar'ri sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui, 15
