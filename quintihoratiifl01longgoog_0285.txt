ΟΑΒΜΕΝ XI.

ibus will be found in this sud in the only other two Sepphio odes contained in this
book nore deviatione, in tbe proportion oi nearly four to one, from tbe osesural arrange·
ment obmed in the ιιι-οι three books then in all the odes of those books put together.
From thia and other inter-nal evidence it has been argued thet thieode is a late one, but
l think tbearguments are inconcluaive. It is true that Horace addresses Phyllis aa his
latiore, but not, so far aa 1 een see, in the tone oia person now grown old, as Butt-
naun says Most men wishing to plesse a woman vow eonstunoy to her, and one who
w obliged to confess thet be bad been inconstant to others would only be the more ve·
benentin professing stediastness ιο her whom he desii-ed for the occasion to wiu. ButI
do not mean ιο express any decided opinion one way or the other. lt is only important
ιο bear in mind that this book was publishod, not to revise Horeoe's repetition ss a
writer oi amatory verm, bnt st the desire of the emperor, who wished tho prsises of his
&qm ιο be sent forth to the world, and his own with them. The ode to Lyde, on
tbeday ofthe Neptunalia (0. iii. 28), is like this snd has more spirit. It is not im·
possible Horace may bare written this as early as the otber, but thought the other
better, and that oneoi thskind was enough for publication. 'lhe form ‘spargier' which
occure nowhere else in the odes, gives this the appearance oia different style oi
composition from others t but whether this is due to design or carelessness, or to its
bring sn early criste productior, mnnot bo determiued. lt is not at ull unlikely, as
me commentator bas supposed, that tho odo was sent to Maeeenas on his birtbdsy,
sud m only thrown into tbs iorni of an address to Phyllis ior poetieal convenience.
