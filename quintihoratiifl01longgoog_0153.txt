CARMINUM II. 13. 113

Num tu quae tenuit dives Achaemenes,

Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes
Permutare velis crine Licymniae,
Plenas aut Arabum domos,

Dum flagrantia detorquet ad oscula 25
Cervicem ant facili saevitia negat

Quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,
Interdum rapere occupet?

iia 29.) The invitation ιο Maecenas was written evidently for the first anniversary oi
tte accident referred to in this ode. Lachmann (Iip. to Franks, p. 240) considers it to
heom ci Horace's earliest, in consequence ci the metrc of v. 27, “Alcaec, plectro
dna navis ;” and for similar reasons he puts C. iii. 8 st an early date. But such con·
dnsions have been already noticed. 'lhereis nothing in them, as 1 believe, whatever.
'ibe latter part oi the orie is a remarkable instance of Horace’s vray of digrusing inte
wbietts only remotely connected with his principal theme.
