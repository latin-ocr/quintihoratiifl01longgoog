coast of Italy. When this happened nobody knows. After the publica·
tion cf the three books of Odes, Horace seems ιο have ceased from that
style of writing, or nearly so; and the only other compositione we know
ol his having produced in the next few years are metrical Epistles to
different friends, of which he published a volume probably iu amc. 734
or 735. Ηο seems ιο have taken up the study of the Greek philoso-
phieal writers, end to heve got a good deal iuterested in them, and also
to have beeorm a little tired of the world and diegusted with the
jcalousies his reputation created. His health did not improve as he got
older, aud he put himself under the aare of Antonius Musa, the em·
perora new physicam. By his advice he gave up, for a time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But he found it necessary ιο be a good deal away
lrom Rome, especially in the autumn and winter‘.

In auo. 737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Saeculares, and Horace
uss required ιο write au Ode for the occasion, which he did, aud ithae
bem preserved. This circumstance, and the credit it brought him, may
hare given his mind another leaning to Ode-writing, aud have helped
him to produce the fourth book, a few pieces iu which may have been
written at any time. Ῑι is said that Augustus particularly desired
lloraea to publish another book of Odes, in order that those he wrote
upon the victorias of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear iu
it. The latter of these Odes was not written, I believe, till amc. 741,
when Augustus returned from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. The Odes of the
fourth book show no diminution of power, but the reverse. There are
none in the lirst three books that surpass or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour of Drusus, aud few superior ιο that which is addressed to

lollius. The success of the first three books, and the honour of being
cbosen to composa the Ode at the Ludi Saeculares, seem ιο have given
him encouragemeut. There are uo incidente in his life during the above
period recorded or alluded ιο in his poema. He lived five years alter
the publication of the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct,
aud during that time I think it probable he wrote the Epistles ιο Au-
gustus and Florus which form the second book; and having conceived

the intention of writing a poem ou the art and progress of poetry, he
wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the Pisones which has
been preserved among his works. The fragments of which that poem
appears to be composed, aud which some have vainly tried to reduce ιο
acensistent whole, may have been written earlier thau 1 have supposed ;
bnt there is so much affinity between the Ars Poetica and the Epistle
tc Augustus that 1 believe they were written at no grem interval of
